MSFT is buying stakes in AI companies so that the AI companies have capital to operate. Often they spend that capital at MSFT’s boutique Azure.

I guess then, that our reactions would depend on who ACME has invested in and who will buy the datacentre capacity and so forth. If ACME gave money to OpenAI so that OpenAI can buy services from it, you might be skeptical.

Other examples of ""round tripping"" have been pretty blatant and concerning. This purchase (Microsoft) along with other funders, purchasing a data center company, is needed. If you've been following the news around MSFT you'd know that Microsoft data centers can't keep up with the demand for compute and inference requests. They've been scrambling to expand their existing azure data centers, and they've been scrambling to lease capacity from data centers also. 

This seems pretty straightforward. Microsoft found a data center company to buy. NVDA being connected to the funding however, this could be a round trip transaction for them, if they somehow get revenue back from this data center Corp in the form of buying more overpriced GPUs. 

These other examples of round tripping have been pretty bad though.

comment,stocks,MSFT,njjbhk9,Is Microsoft going to be effected in any long term way with Xbox basically trying to hang itself with a golden noose,"Console are loss leaders. Microsoft and Sony hardly make profit on consoles; they often lose money on console so they can lock you into their ecosystem. In November 2022, Phil Spencer said that Microsoft looses about $100-200 for every Xbox sold. 

They're sold near or below cost while games, subscriptions, DLC, and accessories are sold at markups for profit. (Nintendo does sell consoles for a profit, just different strategies.)

Getting rid of consoles would boost the profitability of the gaming division, benefitting Microsoft

Also, just by simply mathematics, boosting the gamepass subscription by 50% can only harm them if they lose 33% or more of customers. That's just not happening, and if it did, they can always just reverse it. Gamepass is still a great deal if you use it a lot, and Microsoft knows how to price things properly.

MSFT is buying stakes in AI companies so that the AI companies have capital to operate. Often they spend that capital at MSFT’s boutique Azure.

I guess then, that our reactions would depend on who ACME has invested in and who will buy the datacentre capacity and so forth. If ACME gave money to OpenAI so that OpenAI can buy services from it, you might be skeptical.

Other examples of ""round tripping"" have been pretty blatant and concerning. This purchase (Microsoft) along with other funders, purchasing a data center company, is needed. If you've been following the news around MSFT you'd know that Microsoft data centers can't keep up with the demand for compute and inference requests. They've been scrambling to expand their existing azure data centers, and they've been scrambling to lease capacity from data centers also. 

This seems pretty straightforward. Microsoft found a data center company to buy. NVDA being connected to the funding however, this could be a round trip transaction for them, if they somehow get revenue back from this data center Corp in the form of buying more overpriced GPUs. 

These other examples of round tripping have been pretty bad though.

comment,stocks,MSFT,njjbhk9,Is Microsoft going to be effected in any long term way with Xbox basically trying to hang itself with a golden noose,"Console are loss leaders. Microsoft and Sony hardly make profit on consoles; they often lose money on console so they can lock you into their ecosystem. In November 2022, Phil Spencer said that Microsoft looses about $100-200 for every Xbox sold. 

They're sold near or below cost while games, subscriptions, DLC, and accessories are sold at markups for profit. (Nintendo does sell consoles for a profit, just different strategies.)

Getting rid of consoles would boost the profitability of the gaming division, benefitting Microsoft

Also, just by simply mathematics, boosting the gamepass subscription by 50% can only harm them if they lose 33% or more of customers. That's just not happening, and if it did, they can always just reverse it. Gamepass is still a great deal if you use it a lot, and Microsoft knows how to price things properly.

post,SecurityAnalysis,MSFT,1ktkrt6,🚀Inside Chris Hohn’s TCI: Lessons from an 18% Compounder (1/2),"I cut some stuff out, full post is --> [here](https://thematicedge.substack.com/p/inside-chris-hohns-tci-lessons-from).

(...)

Hohn’s performance has been nothing short of stellar. [The fund has delivered an 18% annualized return since inception](https://hedgefundalpha.com/chris-hohn-portfolio/)—remarkably close to [Buffett’s outstanding 20% for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders](https://fortune.com/2025/05/17/warren-buffett-success-berkshire-hathaway-stocks/).

Let’s take a quick look at the portfolio and identify a few patterns. Below are the fund’s top 10 positions. With five holdings each representing more than 10% of assets, it’s fair to say the fund is highly concentrated.

https://preview.redd.it/8u67qe29ij2f1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=23896a6eb5ecf603b742ae4775b4517fcd36d110

Source: [whalewisdom.com](http://whalewisdom.com)

One pattern that stands out is the balanced mix of asset-heavy and asset-light business models—yet all are dominant players in their respective markets:

* **Asset-heavy models** like Canadian Pacific (CP), Canadian National (CN), and Ferrovial (which operates toll roads and airports) are essentially **natural monopolies.**
* **Asset-light tech giants** like Alphabet and Microsoft command over 50% market share in their core businesses—**modern-day digital monopolies**.
* **Moody’s and S&P Global**, the leading rating agencies, are foundational to the financial system and operate in highly consolidated markets—similar to **Visa** in payments.
* **GE Aerospace**, the fund’s largest position, deserves its own mention. It’s the leader in commercial aircraft engines with an estimated 50% market share. Hohn is negative on airlines but still wants exposure to the secular growth in air travel—GE lets him monetize that trend without the margin pressure of the airline industry.

**Next week**, we’ll attempt to reconstruct the 200-stock investable universe Hohn referred to. I’m convinced it will include many thematic winners.

...

And here’s a quick breakdown of that amazing podcast with Chris Hohn from The Children’s Investment Fund.

* **Start with moats, not growth** Moats > growth. Hohn only invests in businesses with *true* barriers to entry (network effects, IP, switching costs). No moat = no thanks.Examples: Aena (airport monopoly), GE/Safran (jet engines), Meta/Visa (network scale).
* **Essential > discretionary** He likes irreplaceable businesses with pricing power — like ratings agencies or infrastructure. If you *have* to use it and they can raise prices above inflation, he’s interested.
* **No “profitless growth”** Airlines grow 5% a year… and barely make money. He avoids low-margin and overhyped businesses with no real earnings power.
* **Blacklist of bad industries** Hohn avoids sectors with high competition and little pricing power: ✘ Banks ✘ Autos ✘ Retail ✘ Insurance ✘ Airlines ✘ Commodities ✘ Media ✘ Asset managers, etc. His investable universe is only \~200 stocks globally.
* **Long-term mindset** TCI holds stocks for 8+ years. DCF > multiples. It’s all about compounding intrinsic value, not trading around short-term noise.
* **High conviction, concentrated bets** 10–15 stocks. Top 5 = 72% of the portfolio. Deep research + decades of experience = strong intuition.
* **Philanthropy at the core** Hohn donates nearly all his earnings. Proving that purpose and performance can go hand in hand.",Necessary_Pattern753,34,0.95,3.0,2025-05-23 16:20:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1ktkrt6/inside_chris_hohns_tci_lessons_from_an_18/,https://reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1ktkrt6/inside_chris_hohns_tci_lessons_from_an_18/

# Why Industry Maps Matter 🗺️ A Closer Look at Gaming 🕹️

Despite broader pressure on consumer sentiment and tech multiples, gaming showed resilience — supported by strong brand IP, recurring revenues, and enduring demand for interactive entertainment. When a segment shows strength in two very different market environments, it often points to something deeper: a **secular growth story** worth understanding.

We want to understand this industry better — how it works, where each company plays, and where the most investable opportunities lie. To do that, we want to built an **industry map**. How can we do this and what would be a good tool to do this methodically?

# What’s an Industry Map — and Why Use One?

Think of an industry map as a **visual x-ray** of a market. It helps answer key questions like:

* What are the business models in this space?
* Where in the value chain does each player operate?
* Who is vertically integrated? Who’s focused on a niche?
* Where does the money flow?

One helpful way to frame it comes from [Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan in their excellent piece, “Measuring the Moat” (Morgan Stanley):](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_measuringthemoat.pdf)

>

They included an industry map for the U.S. airline industry — which isn’t really driven by a secular growth trend — and I also believe the visualization could be more informative. For instance, major players like airports are missing entirely. I think we can do better, and I’d love your feedback.

# A Better Use Case: Gaming Industry Map (Simplified)

Here’s a **simplified industry map** I built for the gaming sector.

[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCiL2iRu1EQaMjzrct3AX6dNeozw_Yfw/view?usp=sharing)

This version captures the **core business models**. The logos indicate which companies are active in each field:

* **Nintendo** is a pure-play gaming company operating as a *Vertically Integrated Ecosystem*. It develops, publishes, owns the platform, and also sells the hardware — most notably, the Nintendo Switch.
* The same is true for **Sony**, which owns the PlayStation ecosystem. However, the key difference lies on the right side of the table: Sony also generates significant revenue from *non-gaming* segments. So while its gaming business is structurally similar to Nintendo’s, it is **not** a pure play, also visible via the lower “Megatrend Exposure”.
* **Take-Two**, the company behind the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise, is a pure-play *developer and publisher*. Its DNA is creating compelling gaming content, which is then monetized through platforms like Nintendo (Switch), Sony (PlayStation), or Microsoft (Xbox).
* **Logitech** and **Corsair** fall into the *hardware* category, providing physical gaming gear and accessories to players and streamers alike.
* You might know the saying, *“During a gold rush, sell shovels.”* That’s exactly what **AppLovin** and **Unity** are doing. They are *infrastructure* plays — enabling developers to monetize games via advertising tech, or supporting them with development tools and game engines.

You can immediately see **who plays where** and who may benefit most from digital trends, cross-platform IP, and rising monetization sophistication.

# Going Deeper: Gaming Value Chain Exposure

Here’s a more detailed version. This is how I would structure a market map for my own reference — something I’d keep on my desk.

[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GcBWvY_HlFJFuIVHEGZcRpqQEV4_EW_S/view?usp=sharing)

The main differences include:

* Revenue breakdowns by segment
* A few examples of key products and services

# What Else Would Add Value?

I see this industry map as a first step toward identifying compelling stocks and segments within gaming. The natural next step, to me, is to dig into the financials and assess which parts of the industry are more profitable or growing faster than others. I’d be looking at:

* Long-term revenue growth patterns
* Differences in margin structures and return on capital profiles
* Whether this translates into superior shareholder returns

Such a **benchmarking deck** would help pinpoint which business models and companies are most attractive for long-term ownership.

Once you’ve shortlisted the stocks to prioritize, you’ll probably want to gather additional insights — such as:

* Deep-dive investment cases
* Podcasts explaining the industry landscape
* Interviews with senior executives

Would a curated list of this kind of content be helpful?

# Please Let Me Know

* Is the simplified industry map too basic — or just right? What would you add?
* Is the more detailed version too complex? How would you adjust it?
* Would a benchmarking slide deck be useful?
* Would a curated list of investment cases, podcasts, interviews, etc. be of interest?

Reply to this post or reach out directly. I'm thinking of adjusting the industry map a bit after your feedback, adding the benchmarking deck, but also layering in external research like investment cases, podcasts, and executive interviews.

The idea is that this format could easily be replicated for other thematic segments with strong secular tailwinds — like semiconductors or defense stocks — helping investors quickly understand who plays where, what drives value, and where to dig deeper.",value-added,11,0.79,0.0,2025-05-15 15:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1kn8bij/why_industry_maps_matter_a_closer_look_at_gaming/,https://reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1kn8bij/why_industry_maps_matter_a_closer_look_at_gaming/
post,SecurityAnalysis,MSFT,1ktkrt6,🚀Inside Chris Hohn’s TCI: Lessons from an 18% Compounder (1/2),"I cut some stuff out, full post is --> [here](https://thematicedge.substack.com/p/inside-chris-hohns-tci-lessons-from).

(...)

Hohn’s performance has been nothing short of stellar. [The fund has delivered an 18% annualized return since inception](https://hedgefundalpha.com/chris-hohn-portfolio/)—remarkably close to [Buffett’s outstanding 20% for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders](https://fortune.com/2025/05/17/warren-buffett-success-berkshire-hathaway-stocks/).

Let’s take a quick look at the portfolio and identify a few patterns. Below are the fund’s top 10 positions. With five holdings each representing more than 10% of assets, it’s fair to say the fund is highly concentrated.

https://preview.redd.it/8u67qe29ij2f1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=23896a6eb5ecf603b742ae4775b4517fcd36d110

Source: [whalewisdom.com](http://whalewisdom.com)

One pattern that stands out is the balanced mix of asset-heavy and asset-light business models—yet all are dominant players in their respective markets:

* **Asset-heavy models** like Canadian Pacific (CP), Canadian National (CN), and Ferrovial (which operates toll roads and airports) are essentially **natural monopolies.**
* **Asset-light tech giants** like Alphabet and Microsoft command over 50% market share in their core businesses—**modern-day digital monopolies**.
* **Moody’s and S&P Global**, the leading rating agencies, are foundational to the financial system and operate in highly consolidated markets—similar to **Visa** in payments.
* **GE Aerospace**, the fund’s largest position, deserves its own mention. It’s the leader in commercial aircraft engines with an estimated 50% market share. Hohn is negative on airlines but still wants exposure to the secular growth in air travel—GE lets him monetize that trend without the margin pressure of the airline industry.

**Next week**, we’ll attempt to reconstruct the 200-stock investable universe Hohn referred to. I’m convinced it will include many thematic winners.

...

And here’s a quick breakdown of that amazing podcast with Chris Hohn from The Children’s Investment Fund.

* **Start with moats, not growth** Moats > growth. Hohn only invests in businesses with *true* barriers to entry (network effects, IP, switching costs). No moat = no thanks.Examples: Aena (airport monopoly), GE/Safran (jet engines), Meta/Visa (network scale).
* **Essential > discretionary** He likes irreplaceable businesses with pricing power — like ratings agencies or infrastructure. If you *have* to use it and they can raise prices above inflation, he’s interested.
* **No “profitless growth”** Airlines grow 5% a year… and barely make money. He avoids low-margin and overhyped businesses with no real earnings power.
* **Blacklist of bad industries** Hohn avoids sectors with high competition and little pricing power: ✘ Banks ✘ Autos ✘ Retail ✘ Insurance ✘ Airlines ✘ Commodities ✘ Media ✘ Asset managers, etc. His investable universe is only \~200 stocks globally.
* **Long-term mindset** TCI holds stocks for 8+ years. DCF > multiples. It’s all about compounding intrinsic value, not trading around short-term noise.
* **High conviction, concentrated bets** 10–15 stocks. Top 5 = 72% of the portfolio. Deep research + decades of experience = strong intuition.
* **Philanthropy at the core** Hohn donates nearly all his earnings. Proving that purpose and performance can go hand in hand.",Necessary_Pattern753,39,1.0,3.0,2025-05-23 16:20:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1ktkrt6/inside_chris_hohns_tci_lessons_from_an_18/,https://reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1ktkrt6/inside_chris_hohns_tci_lessons_from_an_18/

post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,1o6qrdt,Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon,"Let's first set aside the fact that every valuation metric is nearing their most historically elevated levels. Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. 

But even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. 

Valuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market ""has"" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. 

So while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. 

Here's why I don't expect a crash. 

>***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** 

>\~ Peter Lynch

I think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. 

In 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. 

In 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. 

Today, just look at the market. Look at the S&P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low. Interest coverage ratios are well within historical bounds ([Goldman Sachs: Exhibit 11](https://www.goldmansachs.com/ayco/materials/isg-content/ISG-impact-of-rising-rates-on-corporate-debt-us-equities.pdf) & [JPM: Page 13](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf)). And these should only improve as rates come down. 

And yes, the Mag 7 make up 30% of the index. But even if the market grew a conscience tomorrow and re-rated the Mag 7 down by 40%, that only represents a 12% decline in the market. 

***The system isn't static.***

>I owned META in 2022 when it was trading at single digit PE levels. I sold it on the basis that the metaverse was a business endeavor that was a destruction in value. They were burning so much cash on it.

>Later that year, Zuck announced that they were scaling back investment on that project, and the rest was history. I never bought back in.

>This is an important lesson when looking at the current state of fiscal policy. We shouldn’t anchor to the 30% global tariffs and 130% tariffs on iPhones. As policy changes, we should update our valuation assumptions with it. I do think we should be cognizant of how unhinged and random the administration is with trade policy, and perhaps ‘some’ extra risk premium should be applied to the market to account for it, but we probably shouldn’t expect some massive repricing event right now.

>Yes, tariffs are still on, but the 10% range is something that is much more palatable for US businesses and consumers.

>Also, the walk-back in policy this past week does signal that the POTUS put is in play. Donald does care what markets are doing.

>\~ [Me, April 12th, 2025](https://substack.com/@riskpremium/note/c-108294047?r=1r289e&utm_source=notes-share-action&utm_medium=web)

This lesson extends to AI capex as well. There's nothing that says that if AI isn't working out that all these companies have to stick with those projects. And the outcome is net zero. Whatever cash comes off of Nvidia's CF statement only lifts the bottom line for the other constituents. So sure, Nvidia probably gets hammered. But it only helps the other companies' bottom lines. That's not to say Microsoft and Google, et. al won't get hurt. There's a lot of potential energy stored in these AI projects. But if the market deems AI as a money-loser, I can only imagine the market will cheer if they pare back on AI projects. 

***There still is some bubble behavior.*** 

With all that being said, there are some pockets of the market that do worry me. Companies like Oklo, Quantumscape, Joby are all pricing in the prospects of a very different future. And that's usually a bad bet. I'm also seeing companies like Solid Power being resurrected from the dead despite having no product, no potential of a product, and on no news. That stock is up almost 7-fold off the lows. These are just a few of the stocks that I follow; you probably personally see it in your own areas of interest. But we're still no where near the levels of euphoria that we saw in late 2020 / early 2021 where ARK funds were a ""sure thing"" and NFTs were auctioning for millions. That's the level of behavior that I think I want to see before I got worried about euphoria. 

And yes, tariffs worry me, and the prospect of a trade war worries me. But again, the system is dynamic. There's really nothing that says tariffs = recession in the same way that Covid didn't equal a global financial meltdown. 

***Summary***

I don't think I see a path to a stock market washout, just yet. 2021 & 2000 are the models for euphoria. 2008 is the model for financial irresponsibility. We currently have neither. AI probably is a bubble, but I also don't think we're pricing in some manic level of optimism there either. Maybe if we get to a point where AI tokens become a line item on balance sheets, then I'll start to worry. We're not there yet.  

That's not to say there isn't excess we could work off, though. And if you're scared of a 20% - 30% correction, that's perfectly okay. It's probably just a sign that you're not positioned correctly for your risk tolerance. I'm not full equities, and I'm certainly no where near 100% US stocks. ***In a world where investors are going increasingly risk-on, it makes sense to take your foot off the pedal.*** But we also shouldn't let the prospect of a 25% correction shake us out of the markets completely. To end with another Peter Lynch quote: 

>***Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.***

They're trading at 38x FCF. That number gets better if AI works and it actually starts bringing in revenue or improving efficiencies internally or if AI doesn't work and they scale back AI spend.

If NBIS can provide reliable, cheaper data storage they stand to be in a good position longterm. They also seem to be integrating themselves with other companies not exclusively focused on AI. 


Is it better to invest in MSFT over NBIS? Probably. But clearly MSFT have identified something NBIS can do that they can't yet. And there may be more short term growth with NBIS. ",Chickentrap,3,,,2025-10-15 00:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6qrdt/why_the_ai_bubble_may_not_pop_anytime_soon/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6qrdt/why_the_ai_bubble_may_not_pop_anytime_soon/njiz7bd/
post,ValueInvesting,GOOGL,1o7ucia,Stock Picker View: Market Overpriced. New Normal or Sit on HYSA or VOO/VUG and Ride the Wave? Or Let's Pick Some Stocks!!??,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Always been a value stock picker guy. Have had my wins and losses. Bought MSFT at 22 in 2009 when it was dead money 10 years prior (I thought MSFT phone was going to be a thing if I'm being honest). Richard Kinder suckered me in to KMI at 40 with his dividend forecasts and then cut it immediately thereafter (but at least I DCA'ed). My 401k is in FSGPX (basically VUG) but I'm a stock picker at heart with MSFT KMI MO ABBV/ABT CSCO WFC a shit ton of GOOGL (lucky but obvious at 150) at the heart of my stock portfolio.  Lost on NOK, SAN (though it's coming back) ARCO and that's about it. 

Anyway, here's my dilemma. What the hell do we buy right now? I honestly still love GOOGL but some of that is rose colored lenses because it's been good to me. But I do think it will be the highest MC stock in the world before long. And I'm not going to buy more of something that's run so hard so fast. But it's basically the Berkshire of tech.

Looked at PFE DIS JD BRK.B. Can't pull the trigger. PFE is the classic value play but of they cut the dividend that's going sub 20 and the pipeline legit scares me unless the GLP-1 drug actually works. DIS has been dead money for years and has no growth. JD is the leader in the clubhouse but China is China. BRK.B I feel like I'm better off just buying VUG and VOO and riding the ridiculous valuations of the market instead of chugging along at 7-8%. Oh and I'm not buying NVO at 1.7T market cap 

My honest opinion is this is a different market and 25 forward PE is the old 10 forward PE and everyone wants to make 100% gains in 3 weeks and making 100% gains in 5 years is boring. Jesus give me 100% gains every 5 years forever please. 

So what's the real play? HYSA at ~4%? VOO/VUG and ride out the dip? Wait for the inevitable correction (which may be in 2 years with AI spending and the current administration)? Or let's pick some fucking stocks?????

post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,1o6zdti,$GRRR - most undervalued AI play on the market,"Gorilla Technology (ticker: GRRR) could be the ONLY undervalued AI and data infrastructure stock in the entire market right with multi-bagger (2-5x) potential within the next few months. now especially with stocks like BBAI, RZLV, NBIS, APLD, IREN, CIFR, etc all up hundreds of % since April.

The company sits around a $400 million market cap, yet holds over $100 million in cash, has minimal debt (~$16M) , and recently announced a $1.4 billion contract in Singapore.

This isn’t a new startup trying to ride the AI wave. Gorilla has been around for more than twenty years, working with governments and major enterprises in AI, cybersecurity, and video analytics. They build the foundation that smart cities, national security systems, and AI-powered data centers run on.

⸻

⭐️What Makes GRRR Different

While companies like BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS have gained attention in the U.S., Gorilla has been quietly building dominance across Southeast Asia, particularly through government, security, and telecom contracts. Their AI-driven video analytics and infrastructure are already deployed in real national systems, not just in pilot phases.

Now they are expanding internationally, and that’s where things get even more interesting, because Gorilla is involved in a massive global initiative called One Amazon.

⸻

⭐️The One Amazon Project

One Amazon isn’t connected to Amazon the company. It’s a large international initiative focused on uniting AI, sustainability, and digital finance to protect and regenerate the Amazon rainforest. It’s backed and supported by major organizations and partners including the White House, Goldman Sachs, AECOM, Chainlink, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). These names alone show that this project isn’t just another idea, it’s a coordinated global effort.

What makes One Amazon especially interesting is its upcoming token launch, where each token represents one hectare of protected land. This gives it actual meaning, something that connects digital assets to real environmental impact. It’s not another meme coin or speculative token with no purpose. It’s meant to represent real-world sustainability value, linking financial markets directly to land conservation.

The global launch and full presentation of the project are expected to happen at COP30 next month, one of the world’s most important climate events. If successful, this could be far more meaningful than any of the hype tokens** out there, because it represents something tangible and beneficial.

Here’s where Gorilla comes in. Gorilla Technology is the primary technology provider for One Amazon, delivering the AI infrastructure, surveillance systems, and smart sensors that make the project possible. Their systems help monitor, protect, and manage the physical environments tied to the One Amazon token, ensuring transparency and security in how land and data are tracked.

In simple terms, Gorilla isn’t just associated with One Amazon, they’re building the core technology that connects the physical world to the digital one. If One Amazon scales as expected, Gorilla’s name could become a household name around the world.

There’s a video on the official One Amazon website that speaks volume about what this revolutionary project is about. I suggest everyone to go take a look.

⸻

⭐️2025 Guidance and Growth Outlook

Gorilla is giving strong guidance for 2025, signaling healthy growth ahead:

Revenue: Expected between $100 million and $110 million for the full year.
Adjusted EBITDA: Projected between $20 million and $25 million.
Gross Margin: Expected to be 40–45%.
Global Project Pipeline: Over $5 billion, with about $1 billion in contracts targeted for closure by mid-2026.
These numbers show Gorilla isn’t just relying on hype or a single project. They have a clear growth plan backed by a large pipeline, major partnerships, and solid fundamentals. That recent $105 million registered direct offering at an offering price of $17.50 per share (current stock price is $18.4 as of today Oct 04, 2025), which closed in July 2025 and was led by a major institutional investor, gave them over 100 million in cash to accelerate growth. This not only strengthens their balance sheet but also provides the resources needed to execute on contracts and expand globally.A $1.4 billion contract in Singapore alone dwarfs their current market cap, making these projections very exciting for long-term holders.

⸻

⭐️The Numbers Tell the Story

At a $400 million market cap, Gorilla already has over $100 million in cash and very little debt. Compare that with BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS, which already trade at significantly higher valuations despite being no where close in realizing their projected revenues yet.

That $1.4B Singapore contract alone is worth more than three times the company’s current market cap. Even if a fraction of it converts into revenue, it would dramatically shift Gorilla’s valuation metrics. On top of that, Gorilla was recently added to the S&P Global BMI Index, which could start attracting passive inflows and institutional attention.

⸻

⭐️Why I Think It’s Special

What stands out about Gorilla is that it’s not chasing headlines or trying to sell AI hype. They’re quietly building the infrastructure that other AI systems rely on. Their combination of strong balance sheet, government contracts, and global expansion positions them perfectly as demand for secure AI infrastructure continues to grow.

If the One Amazon project goes live as planned at COP30 and Gorilla’s role becomes more publicly recognized, the company could easily re-rate from a small-cap to a serious mid-cap within the next couple of years.

Yes, there’s still execution and volatility risk since it’s a smaller stock, but the combination of real contracts, credible partners, and meaningful global initiatives makes it feel like a hidden gem that the market hasn’t priced in yet.

⸻

⭐️Why the Market Hasn’t Caught On Yet

A big reason why GRRR is still so heavily discounted comes down to perception. It’s not a U.S. company, and most of its major customers are in Asia, which makes a lot of U.S. investors skeptical by default. People assume anything based in Asia with large government contracts can’t be fully trusted or verified, so the market automatically prices in a heavy “risk discount.”

There have also been fraud allegations floating around earlier this year from short-seller reports. But when you actually dig into the details, most of those claims have already been debunked or proven exaggerated. The accusations didn’t hold up once the company released more filings and clarified contract details. Despite the noise, no regulatory body has found any wrongdoing, and the company continues to sign new partnerships and win major government deals. Shorts have been taking massive advantage of this sentiment to suppress the stock price but the spring is fully coiled and it is likely going to go off very soon, particularly when Q3 earnings is released mid-Nov.

Then there’s CEO Jay Chandan. Some investors think he sounds too polished or too visionary to be real. He’s confident, ambitious, and talks about connecting AI, sustainability, and global infrastructure, which can sound like fluff to people used to hearing empty promises. But if you look at Gorilla’s actual results, long-term government contracts, real AI infrastructure deployments, and the One Amazon partnership, you start to see that there’s substance behind the story.

Jay also comes across as empathetic, articulate, and long-term focused. He’s not your typical small-cap CEO chasing hype. And the people around him give the company serious credibility. Dr. Raj Natarajan, Gorilla’s current CTO, previously spent years at Microsoft leading product and engineering teams, and Thomas Sennhauser, Intel’s current CTO and Business Lead for Asia-Pacific, recently joined Gorilla’s Board of Directors. Before Intel, Sennhauser spent nearly two decades at HPE in senior technical leadership roles. If you want to dive deeper in the company’s credibility, you can take a look at this post

Their core team includes engineers, AI researchers, and tech specialists who’ve been building advanced surveillance and infrastructure systems for more than two decades. This isn’t a new company trying to capitalize on AI hype, they’ve been quietly doing this work long before “AI infrastructure” became a buzzword.

So yes, skepticism makes sense, and some of the CEO’s confidence might sound over the top at times. But when you step back and look at the fundamentals, the leadership, and the confirmed contracts, the valuation just doesn’t add up. It’s a rare case where skepticism might be creating one of the biggest asymmetrical opportunities out there.

⸻

⭐️TL;DR

Gorilla Technology (GRRR) is sitting at a $400M market cap with over $100M in cash, minimal debt (~$16M) and a $1.4B contract already signed. The current stock price is does not reflect their fundamentals at all. They are deeply involved in the One Amazon initiative, which includes partners like the White House, Goldman Sachs, Chainlink, AECOM, and the IDB, and will officially launch at COP30 next month, which will provide MASSIVE exposure to Gorilla. The project’s token represents one hectare of land, making it one of the world’s first digital assets with true real-world meaning.

While everyone chases meme coins and overvalued AI stocks, Gorilla is quietly building the technology backbone for the future, combining surveillance, AI infrastructure, smart data centres, and sustainable finance to power real‑world projects on a global scale.

It will be one of those companies people will look back on and realize the potential was obvious all along.

post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,1o6qrdt,Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon,"Let's first set aside the fact that every valuation metric is nearing their most historically elevated levels. Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. 

But even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. 

Valuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market ""has"" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. 

So while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. 

Here's why I don't expect a crash. 

>***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** 

>\~ Peter Lynch

I think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. 

In 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. 

In 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. 

Today, just look at the market. Look at the S&P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low. Interest coverage ratios are well within historical bounds ([Goldman Sachs: Exhibit 11](https://www.goldmansachs.com/ayco/materials/isg-content/ISG-impact-of-rising-rates-on-corporate-debt-us-equities.pdf) & [JPM: Page 13](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf)). And these should only improve as rates come down. 

And yes, the Mag 7 make up 30% of the index. But even if the market grew a conscience tomorrow and re-rated the Mag 7 down by 40%, that only represents a 12% decline in the market. 

***The system isn't static.***

>I owned META in 2022 when it was trading at single digit PE levels. I sold it on the basis that the metaverse was a business endeavor that was a destruction in value. They were burning so much cash on it.

>Later that year, Zuck announced that they were scaling back investment on that project, and the rest was history. I never bought back in.

>This is an important lesson when looking at the current state of fiscal policy. We shouldn’t anchor to the 30% global tariffs and 130% tariffs on iPhones. As policy changes, we should update our valuation assumptions with it. I do think we should be cognizant of how unhinged and random the administration is with trade policy, and perhaps ‘some’ extra risk premium should be applied to the market to account for it, but we probably shouldn’t expect some massive repricing event right now.

This lesson extends to AI capex as well. There's nothing that says that if AI isn't working out that all these companies have to stick with those projects. And the outcome is net zero. Whatever cash comes off of Nvidia's CF statement only lifts the bottom line for the other constituents. So sure, Nvidia probably gets hammered. But it only helps the other companies' bottom lines. That's not to say Microsoft and Google, et. al won't get hurt. There's a lot of potential energy stored in these AI projects. But if the market deems AI as a money-loser, I can only imagine the market will cheer if they pare back on AI projects. 

***There still is some bubble behavior.*** 

With all that being said, there are some pockets of the market that do worry me. Companies like Oklo, Quantumscape, Joby are all pricing in the prospects of a very different future. And that's usually a bad bet. I'm also seeing companies like Solid Power being resurrected from the dead despite having no product, no potential of a product, and on no news. That stock is up almost 7-fold off the lows. These are just a few of the stocks that I follow; you probably personally see it in your own areas of interest. But we're still no where near the levels of euphoria that we saw in late 2020 / early 2021 where ARK funds were a ""sure thing"" and NFTs were auctioning for millions. That's the level of behavior that I think I want to see before I got worried about euphoria. 

And yes, tariffs worry me, and the prospect of a trade war worries me. But again, the system is dynamic. There's really nothing that says tariffs = recession in the same way that Covid didn't equal a global financial meltdown. 

***Summary***

I don't think I see a path to a stock market washout, just yet. 2021 & 2000 are the models for euphoria. 2008 is the model for financial irresponsibility. We currently have neither. AI probably is a bubble, but I also don't think we're pricing in some manic level of optimism there either. Maybe if we get to a point where AI tokens become a line item on balance sheets, then I'll start to worry. We're not there yet.  

That's not to say there isn't excess we could work off, though. And if you're scared of a 20% - 30% correction, that's perfectly okay. It's probably just a sign that you're not positioned correctly for your risk tolerance. I'm not full equities, and I'm certainly no where near 100% US stocks. ***In a world where investors are going increasingly risk-on, it makes sense to take your foot off the pedal.*** But we also shouldn't let the prospect of a 25% correction shake us out of the markets completely. To end with another Peter Lynch quote: 

>***Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.***

comment,ValueInvesting,MSFT,njikdgr,Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon,"For sure. I'm not saying that there aren't companies that will be irreparably hurt if AI slows. I just don't think the Mag 7 will be (Nvidia aside) because they have real business models. Microsoft brought in 25 billion in free cash flow last quarter, and AI is net detractor. They're trading at 38x FCF. That number gets better if AI works and it actually starts bringing in revenue or improving efficiencies internally or if AI doesn't work and they scale back AI spend.

If NBIS can provide reliable, cheaper data storage they stand to be in a good position longterm. They also seem to be integrating themselves with other companies not exclusively focused on AI. 


Is it better to invest in MSFT over NBIS? Probably. But clearly MSFT have identified something NBIS can do that they can't yet.

post,financialindependence,AAPL,1nvc9d4,Just laid off. How's my plan for retirement?,"52M, losing my job and wondering if I need to replace it.  

We have 1M in brokerage, 200k in BTC, 1.5M in my 401k and 600k in my wife's 401k.  

Expenses are 110k per year, basically.  If we go to 140k per year, it's comfortable. Bare minimum is 93k per year, but we plan for 110k.

She has and will always have her job teaching.  She's tenured, no pension, only the 401k.  It brings in 34k after taxes and with us sending the max to the 401k, including catch up.  Her raises have never kept up with inflation.

Putting 3M into ficalc and asking for 40 years of planning, it says we are all set.  It gives like a 96% chance of us being good, even without her salary, or even ssa.  If we include her income, it's 100% success.  

1. Do you agree that I can retire now?

2.  How best to handle the 3 accounts?  The taxable one has 300k in 3 month t bills and 93k in swvxx.  The rest of that money has big taxable gains, probably 400k of gains.

Given that we have 4-5 years of expenses in cash and t bills, I'm thinking the following:

All of her 401k in a TDF set for when she plans to retire, say 2040.  All of mine in a TDF set for when I turn 59.5, roughly 2030.  Then basically leave the taxable alone; its mainly LLY, AAPL, NVDA, BRK.B and RNMBY.  Even though I expect a downturn of 30% in the next year and bad inflation to follow, I should be able to wait it out.  

Starting in 2027, our tax bracket will be lower so we could sell equities if needed, but I don't see us doing that until 2029 at the soonest.

post,StockMarket,MSFT,1o4qj1w,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

(...)

Hohn’s performance has been nothing short of stellar. [The fund has delivered an 18% annualized return since inception](https://hedgefundalpha.com/chris-hohn-portfolio/)—remarkably close to [Buffett’s outstanding 20% for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders](https://fortune.com/2025/05/17/warren-buffett-success-berkshire-hathaway-stocks/).

Let’s take a quick look at the portfolio and identify a few patterns. Below are the fund’s top 10 positions. With five holdings each representing more than 10% of assets, it’s fair to say the fund is highly concentrated.

https://preview.redd.it/8u67qe29ij2f1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=23896a6eb5ecf603b742ae4775b4517fcd36d110

Source: [whalewisdom.com](http://whalewisdom.com)

One pattern that stands out is the balanced mix of asset-heavy and asset-light business models—yet all are dominant players in their respective markets:

* **Asset-heavy models** like Canadian Pacific (CP), Canadian National (CN), and Ferrovial (which operates toll roads and airports) are essentially **natural monopolies.**
* **Asset-light tech giants** like Alphabet and Microsoft command over 50% market share in their core businesses—**modern-day digital monopolies**.
* **Moody’s and S&P Global**, the leading rating agencies, are foundational to the financial system and operate in highly consolidated markets—similar to **Visa** in payments.
* **GE Aerospace**, the fund’s largest position, deserves its own mention. It’s the leader in commercial aircraft engines with an estimated 50% market share. Hohn is negative on airlines but still wants exposure to the secular growth in air travel—GE lets him monetize that trend without the margin pressure of the airline industry.

**Next week**, we’ll attempt to reconstruct the 200-stock investable universe Hohn referred to. I’m convinced it will include many thematic winners.

...

And here’s a quick breakdown of that amazing podcast with Chris Hohn from The Children’s Investment Fund.

* **Start with moats, not growth** Moats > growth. Hohn only invests in businesses with *true* barriers to entry (network effects, IP, switching costs). No moat = no thanks.Examples: Aena (airport monopoly), GE/Safran (jet engines), Meta/Visa (network scale).
* **Essential > discretionary** He likes irreplaceable businesses with pricing power — like ratings agencies or infrastructure. If you *have* to use it and they can raise prices above inflation, he’s interested.
* **No “profitless growth”** Airlines grow 5% a year… and barely make money. He avoids low-margin and overhyped businesses with no real earnings power.
* **Blacklist of bad industries** Hohn avoids sectors with high competition and little pricing power: ✘ Banks ✘ Autos ✘ Retail ✘ Insurance ✘ Airlines ✘ Commodities ✘ Media ✘ Asset managers, etc. His investable universe is only \~200 stocks globally.
* **Long-term mindset** TCI holds stocks for 8+ years. DCF > multiples. It’s all about compounding intrinsic value, not trading around short-term noise.
* **High conviction, concentrated bets** 10–15 stocks. Top 5 = 72% of the portfolio. Deep research + decades of experience = strong intuition.
* **Philanthropy at the core** Hohn donates nearly all his earnings.

# Why Industry Maps Matter 🗺️ A Closer Look at Gaming 🕹️

In our recent piece on **Q1 2025 thematic fund performance**, we noted that many megatrend themes stumbled. But one industry held up remarkably well: Gaming! 🚀

The **VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF** (ticker: ESPO) delivered strong returns across both time horizons — the challenging Q1 2025 and the broader 2022–2024 period.

Despite broader pressure on consumer sentiment and tech multiples, gaming showed resilience — supported by strong brand IP, recurring revenues, and enduring demand for interactive entertainment. When a segment shows strength in two very different market environments, it often points to something deeper: a **secular growth story** worth understanding.

We want to understand this industry better — how it works, where each company plays, and where the most investable opportunities lie. To do that, we want to built an **industry map**. How can we do this and what would be a good tool to do this methodically?

# What’s an Industry Map — and Why Use One?

Think of an industry map as a **visual x-ray** of a market. It helps answer key questions like:

* What are the business models in this space?
* Where in the value chain does each player operate?
* Who is vertically integrated? Who’s focused on a niche?
* Where does the money flow?

One helpful way to frame it comes from [Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan in their excellent piece, “Measuring the Moat” (Morgan Stanley):](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_measuringthemoat.pdf)

>

They included an industry map for the U.S. airline industry — which isn’t really driven by a secular growth trend — and I also believe the visualization could be more informative. For instance, major players like airports are missing entirely. I think we can do better, and I’d love your feedback.

# A Better Use Case: Gaming Industry Map (Simplified)

Here’s a **simplified industry map** I built for the gaming sector.

[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCiL2iRu1EQaMjzrct3AX6dNeozw_Yfw/view?usp=sharing)

This version captures the **core business models**. The logos indicate which companies are active in each field:

* **Nintendo** is a pure-play gaming company operating as a *Vertically Integrated Ecosystem*. It develops, publishes, owns the platform, and also sells the hardware — most notably, the Nintendo Switch.
* The same is true for **Sony**, which owns the PlayStation ecosystem. However, the key difference lies on the right side of the table: Sony also generates significant revenue from *non-gaming* segments. So while its gaming business is structurally similar to Nintendo’s, it is **not** a pure play, also visible via the lower “Megatrend Exposure”.
* **Take-Two**, the company behind the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise, is a pure-play *developer and publisher*. Its DNA is creating compelling gaming content, which is then monetized through platforms like Nintendo (Switch), Sony (PlayStation), or Microsoft (Xbox).
* **Logitech** and **Corsair** fall into the *hardware* category, providing physical gaming gear and accessories to players and streamers alike.
* You might know the saying, *“During a gold rush, sell shovels.”* That’s exactly what **AppLovin** and **Unity** are doing. They are *infrastructure* plays — enabling developers to monetize games via advertising tech, or supporting them with development tools and game engines.

You can immediately see **who plays where** and who may benefit most from digital trends, cross-platform IP, and rising monetization sophistication.

# Going Deeper: Gaming Value Chain Exposure

Here’s a more detailed version. This is how I would structure a market map for my own reference — something I’d keep on my desk.

[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GcBWvY_HlFJFuIVHEGZcRpqQEV4_EW_S/view?usp=sharing)

The main differences include:

* Revenue breakdowns by segment
* A few examples of key products and services

# What Else Would Add Value?

I see this industry map as a first step toward identifying compelling stocks and segments within gaming. The natural next step, to me, is to dig into the financials and assess which parts of the industry are more profitable or growing faster than others. I’d be looking at:

* Long-term revenue growth patterns
* Differences in margin structures and return on capital profiles
* Whether this translates into superior shareholder returns

Such a **benchmarking deck** would help pinpoint which business models and companies are most attractive for long-term ownership.

Once you’ve shortlisted the stocks to prioritize, you’ll probably want to gather additional insights — such as:

* Deep-dive investment cases
* Podcasts explaining the industry landscape
* Interviews with senior executives

Would a curated list of this kind of content be helpful?

# Please Let Me Know

* Is the simplified industry map too basic — or just right? What would you add?
* Is the more detailed version too complex? How would you adjust it?
* Would a benchmarking slide deck be useful?
* Would a curated list of investment cases, podcasts, interviews, etc. be of interest?

Reply to this post or reach out directly. I'm thinking of adjusting the industry map a bit after your feedback, adding the benchmarking deck, but also layering in external research like investment cases, podcasts, and executive interviews.

The idea is that this format could easily be replicated for other thematic segments with strong secular tailwinds — like semiconductors or defense stocks — helping investors quickly understand who plays where, what drives value, and where to dig deeper.",value-added,12,0.8,0.0,2025-05-15 15:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1kn8bij/why_industry_maps_matter_a_closer_look_at_gaming/,https://reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1kn8bij/why_industry_maps_matter_a_closer_look_at_gaming/

(...)

Hohn’s performance has been nothing short of stellar. [The fund has delivered an 18% annualized return since inception](https://hedgefundalpha.com/chris-hohn-portfolio/)—remarkably close to [Buffett’s outstanding 20% for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders](https://fortune.com/2025/05/17/warren-buffett-success-berkshire-hathaway-stocks/).

Let’s take a quick look at the portfolio and identify a few patterns. Below are the fund’s top 10 positions. With five holdings each representing more than 10% of assets, it’s fair to say the fund is highly concentrated.
