1o8oydh,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Can Brokerages Share/Sell Your Trading Data?,"Hi all,
my apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.

I've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since. Over the last ~6 years I've regularly bought SPY & VTI, and some AAPL, GOOGL, AMD, MSFT, NET, companies i am passionate about and follow intently. 

last week, i transfered some cash into my trading account and decided to disperse it evenly amongst SPY, VTI, and SCHD. Ever since, my Google News feed has been sharing nonstop reports about SCHD from websites like Seeking Alpha, Tipranks, etc... everyday, front and center in the ""For You"" panel. 

I am 100% certain i have done nothing to search, research, talk, text, or do anything inbetween to discuss this beyond just clicking the ""order"" button in the Schwab app once. 

So, how the F does google know about my recent purchase?",cornelius_cumquat,8,0.79,11.0,2025-10-17 04:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/

1o8cw2k,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline (most people are focusing on interest rate cuts, but ignoring this fatal truth)","The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month, but Powell's statement last night is the real bombshell, signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction. Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.

Balance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults. When the Fed sells mortgage bonds, it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings. When it sells Treasury bonds, corporate bond issuance costs also rise. This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity, which requires closer scrutiny. History always repeats itself. On the eve of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn't stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero. Ultimately, it was the initiation of Q1, or reverse balance sheet reduction, that stabilized the financial system. In his speech yesterday, Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets. This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019, when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10%, nearly shutting down Wall Street. He's clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake, and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment. On the surface, the US stock market is still rising, but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants, which together account for over 32% of the S&P 500's weighting. The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium-sized businesses are struggling with financing costs. This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate, but the patient's hands and feet are already cold. Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy. Even more subversive, halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic. When the Fed expands its balance sheet again, it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar. This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash. He didn't rush to cut interest rates back then, but instead directly injected liquidity into the market, successfully stemming the spread of the crisis. Powell's approach is now precisely the same. For businesses, this is an even more life-or-death situation. The Treasury Department issues $1 trillion in bonds every quarter. If the Fed stops selling them, it effectively lowers the government's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, giants like Apple and Microsoft, with $800 billion in cash on hand, will be in for a rude awakening. Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash, and the money they hold is quietly evaporating. So, when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts, remember the deeper meaning behind Powell's move, as quoted by Dave Reifsner, Director of Research at the Federal Reserve.

A famous governance maxim: When interest rates hit rock bottom, the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon. This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game. Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight; halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall. This move today will undoubtedly upset some. But it must be said. In the financial world, the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay. Remember, on the night of October 15, 2025, when history turns, some will hear only the wind, while others will see the shape of the storm. Now it's your turn. Are you one of the 97% who are focused on interest rate cuts, or the 11% who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction?

* Arizona expansion: planning to acquire additional land to support a U.S. GigaFab; continue investing while remaining disciplined on spend.
* TSMC on margins: N2 will dilute gross margin in 2026, while N3 dilution is easing and should reach the corporate average sometime in 2026. Management says N2’s structural profitability is better than N3 and that counting quarters to reach the corporate average is less useful as overall gross margin keeps rising.

  
MAG7:

* GOOGL - says it built a new 27B-parameter model for single-cell biology, C2S-Scale 27B (based on Gemma), that predicted a new cancer-cell behavior and had that hypothesis validated in living cells.   The model found that combining a CK2 inhibitor (silmitasertib) with low-dose interferon boosted antigen presentation by \~50% in tests—turning “cold” tumors “hot.”
* MSFT , AWS - AWS are fast-tracking plans to move their tech manufacturing out of China.
* NVDA - is teaming up with Australian startup Firmus Technologies to build a new network of renewable-powered AI data centers under Project Southgate, a $2.9 billion initiative already underway in Melbourne and Tasmania, per Bloomberg.
* AAPl - AI division just took another hit. Bloomberg reports that Ke Yang, who was recently promoted to lead Apple’s new Answers, Knowledge and Information (AKI) team, the group building a ChatGPT-like web search system for Siri, is leaving to join META

OTHER COMPANIES:

* TSM - Following their earnings, BofA raises PT to 360 from 330. ""Real demand from AI was one of the focal points during the earnings call, and we sense that the company is turning a bit more positive on the long-term growth trajectory (though keeping the mid-40s% CAGR).
* AMKR - higher on the following comments from TSM: CEO: TSMC is working with Amkor in Arizona even as it builds its own advanced packaging plants because Amkor has already broken ground, its schedule is earlier, and TSMC wants to support customer timelines.
* NBIS:launched AI Cloud 3.0 “Aether,” its latest platform with enterprise-grade security and compliance for regulated industries.  The update adds SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and ISO 27799 certifications, aligning with NIS2, DORA, ISO 27032, and ISO 27701 frameworks to support AI workloads in healthcare, finance, and government.
* RKLB -RKLB initiated by Baird with a PT of 83. ""firmly established as a reliable space launch provider""
* JACK in the Box will sell Del Taco to Yadav Enterprises for $115M cash, after buying it in 2021 for \~$575M incl. debt, roughly an 80% haircut. Proceeds go to repay 2019-1 A-2-II notes as JACK refocuses on its core brand.
* SNOW- And PLTR announced a major AI and data integration partnership, linking Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud with Palantir Foundry and AIP to help enterprises build AI applications faster and manage data more efficiently.
* AIRO  Group and Ukraine-based Bullet signed a 50/50 joint venture LOI to produce interceptor drones for U.S. and NATO markets.
* Honeywell’s board approved the spin-off of Solstice Advanced Materials, set for October 30. Shareholders of record on Oct 17 will receive 1 SOLS share for every 4 HON shares.

* CRWV - launched “AI Object Storage,” a fully managed data platform built for AI workloads. Powered by its LOTA tech, it offers local-like performance, global data access with zero egress fees, and claims over 75% lower storage costs for developers.
* CELH - Piper Sandler reiterates overweight on CELH, PT at 69. We continue to believe Celsius remains well positioned near and long-term. While it may have some noise near-term from tariffs flowing into COGS and a distribution change for Alani Nu, these have been well communicated (and Alani Nu's mid-quarter transition should minimize disruptions, at least from a timing shift/reporting point of view).
* The positives remain clear, as we have strong visibility on distribution gains in its Spring shelf resets, driven by its new category captain role in the space.
* BMNR - B Riley initiates on BMNR with Buy rating, sets PT at 90. ""BMNR is the largest Ethereum DATCO, with an experienced management team and what we believe are achievable plans to acquire a 5% stake in the Ethereum network.
* HPE \_ Bernstein calls HPE's guidance  ""underwhelming"", FY26 EPS $2.20–2.40 came below consensus $2.41, while FY28 >$3 is roughly inline. The $1B Juniper synergy target is seen as a “show-me” story, and leverage reduction plans (3x→2x by FY27) limit near-term shareholder returns.
* AEP - secured a $1.6B DOE loan guarantee to upgrade 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states. The preferred-rate financing will save customers $275M, create 1,100 jobs, and support 24 GW of new demand from AI, data centers, and manufacturing.
* UNH - TD COwen raises PT to 335 from 275, calls it a buy. We see a potentially favorable 2027 MA Advance Notice as a positive leading indicator for UnitedHealth. We see potential upside to MA margin recovery expectations for 2027 and beyond, but continue to be cautious into 2026 primarily from the continued impacts from v28.
* SE - BoFA upgrades to Buy from neutral, raise PT to 215 rom 206. Sea stock has largely been range bound for the last couple of months despite improving momentum on the ground. It was also down 10% yesterday on concerns of expansion in LatAm and slower margin uptake due to investment; both things are not new in our view.
* XPEV - PLANS TO MASS-PRODUCE FLYING CARS NEXT YEAR
* Nestlé shares jumped more than 8%, their biggest one-day gain since 2008, after the company posted stronger-than-expected Q3 sales and unveiled plans to cut 16,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global workforce, over the next two years.
* CRM - CRM Salesforce just set a $60B+ FY30 revenue target, projecting a return to double-digit organic growth (10%+ CAGR from FY26–FY30)
* The company also aims to hit the Rule of 50, excluding informatica

This isn't like the Trump Tariff tweet where everything tanked on algos. I feel as though it's more calculated... so my question is, what do you think is happening?

1o7ucia,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Stock Picker View: Market Overpriced. New Normal or Sit on HYSA or VOO/VUG and Ride the Wave? Or Let's Pick Some Stocks!!??,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Always been a value stock picker guy. Have had my wins and losses. Bought MSFT at 22 in 2009 when it was dead money 10 years prior (I thought MSFT phone was going to be a thing if I'm being honest). Richard Kinder suckered me in to KMI at 40 with his dividend forecasts and then cut it immediately thereafter (but at least I DCA'ed). My 401k is in FSGPX (basically VUG) but I'm a stock picker at heart with MSFT KMI MO ABBV/ABT CSCO WFC a shit ton of GOOGL (lucky but obvious at 150) at the heart of my stock portfolio.  Lost on NOK, SAN (though it's coming back) ARCO and that's about it. 

Anyway, here's my dilemma. What the hell do we buy right now? I honestly still love GOOGL but some of that is rose colored lenses because it's been good to me. But I do think it will be the highest MC stock in the world before long. And I'm not going to buy more of something that's run so hard so fast. But it's basically the Berkshire of tech.

Looked at PFE DIS JD BRK.B. Can't pull the trigger. PFE is the classic value play but of they cut the dividend that's going sub 20 and the pipeline legit scares me unless the GLP-1 drug actually works. DIS has been dead money for years and has no growth. JD is the leader in the clubhouse but China is China. BRK.B I feel like I'm better off just buying VUG and VOO and riding the ridiculous valuations of the market instead of chugging along at 7-8%. Oh and I'm not buying NVO at 1.7T market cap 

My honest opinion is this is a different market and 25 forward PE is the old 10 forward PE and everyone wants to make 100% gains in 3 weeks and making 100% gains in 5 years is boring. Jesus give me 100% gains every 5 years forever please. 

So what's the real play? HYSA at ~4%? VOO/VUG and ride out the dip? Wait for the inevitable correction (which may be in 2 years with AI spending and the current administration)? Or let's pick some fucking stocks?????

TL;DR I feel like the market is hyper overpriced right now and I don't know what to do with my money.

* Under Executive Order 14299, the Army must operate its first Army-regulated reactor by September 30, 2028. The reactors will be commercially owned and operated, using a milestone-based model similar to NASA’s COTS program to accelerate deployment.

  
ASML earnings:

* CFO Roger Dassen said the company is “well prepared” for China’s new rare-earth export rules and has already secured the materials it needs for the coming months.
* “We have long lead times, and therefore, also in our supply chain, we make sure that we have the materials in that we need for the next couple of months,” Dassen told reporters after ASML’s Q3 results.
* Rev: €7.5B vs est: €7.65B 
* EPS €5.49 vs est €5.37 
* Net bookings: €5.4B vs est, €5.2B  

**Outlook Q**4

* **ASMLdoes not expect 2026 total net sales to be below 2025.**
* FY guidance 2026 will be given in January
* Dividend of €1.6 will be made payable in november.
* A new buyback program will be released in January. The 2025 program will likely not be finalized. 
* Highlights from the CEO statement:
* On the technology side, we see litho intensity continue to develop positively as EUV adoption gains momentum,  including progress on High NA EUV
* On the market side, we have seen continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and have also seen this  extending to more customers, both in leading-edge Logic and advanced DRAM. 
* On the other hand, we expect China customer demand, and therefore our China total net sales in 2026 to decline significantly compared to our very strong  business there in 2024 and 2025

  
MAg7:

* NVDA, MSFT: BlackRock, Nvidia, Microsoft, and xAI have formed a consortium to acquire Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, according to the Financial Times.  The group, which also includes GIP, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and backers like Temasek and Kuwait Investment Authority, plans to double Aligned’s 50 data center campuses across the U.S. and Latin America.  NVDA - HSBC upgrades to Buy from Hold, Raises PT to $320 from $200; STREET HIGH. ""We upgrade NVIDIA to Buy on the back of increasing FY27e GPU total addressable market (TAM) relative to our previous expectations, leading to an upward revision in our FY27e datacenter revenue to USD351bn, which remains 36% above consensus forecast of USD258bn. 
* We also see potential easing of China GPU uncertainties following the potential US-China trade deal that could enable NVIDIA to see a demand recovery in the Chinese market. Hence, our revised FY27e (YE Jan) EPS of USD8.75 is now once again significantly above consensus EPS forecast of USD6.48 despite not including any revenue from chip exports to China in FY27e.
* AAPL -  (Neutral, PT $220): “Wait times continue to trend flattish to lower WoW across the lineup”""UBS Evidence Lab data (>Access Dataset) that tracks iPhone availability across 30 geographies suggests wait times for the iPhone 17 lineup continue to trend flattish to lower WoW across key geographies. Based on how the data tracked last year for the iPhone 16 lineup, we would expect these trends to continue going forward.  Notably, wait times for the Pro Max ticked lower by \~4 days WoW ex-China and are now lower on a YoY basis on average. Wait times for the Pro declined \~9 days WoW in the US, while the Air and Base wait times are consistent WoW.  Separately, according to reports, Apple has received approval to begin selling the iPhone 17 Air in China, with preorders starting on October 17th and availability on October 22nd.
* GOOGL - Waymo will launch its driverless ride-hailing service in London next year, marking its European debut and second international market after Tokyo, according to Bloomberg. The Alphabet unit will begin testing a small fleet with safety drivers across a 100-square-mile area in London before a commercial rollout in 2026. It’s partnering with Uber-backed Moove to manage the fleet.  AAPL - CEO Tim Cook pledged to boost investment in China during his visit, despite Trump’s tariff threats on foreign-made goods. Cook met China’s Industry Minister Li Lecheng and said Apple will strengthen cooperation with local suppliers.

* NXT and TE -signed a multi-year, $75M+ solar frame supply deal tied to T1’s new 5-GW Dallas plant.The agreement replaces imported aluminum frames with U.S.-made specialty steel frames, part of Nextracker’s patented module frame tech. Both firms called it a step toward domestic solar manufacturing and energy security, with Nextracker expanding capacity in Texas to support production.
* DLTR - reaffirmed its near-term outlook and unveiled a 3-year EPS growth target of 12–15% CAGR (FY26–FY28) ahead of its 2025 Investor Day in New York. FY26 EPS is projected to grow in the high teens, driven by tariff mitigation, multi-price conversions, and the Family Dollar sale. QTD comp sales are up 3.8%, and the company repurchased 2.8M shares for $271M.  LLY - said its oral GLP-1 drug orforglipron delivered superior blood-sugar control in two Phase 3 trials for type 2 diabetes. In ACHIEVE-2, A1C dropped up to 1.7% vs. 0.8% with dapagliflozin; in ACHIEVE-5, A1C fell up to 2.1% vs. 0.8% with placebo plus insulin. Both studies met all endpoints with consistent safety. Lilly plans to seek global approval in 2026.
* FSLR - BofA raises PT to $254 from $209. ""In our view, First Solar’s U.S. finishing buildout marks the transition from policy-driven upside to execution-led growth. FEOC, AD/CVD, and Section 232 continue to restrict China-linked imports, while the pending poly 232 investigation could create a unified enforcement regime and extend U.S. pricing power.
* We raise our PO to $254 (was $209) as we incorporate 3.5GW of incremental U.S. finishing capacity by 4Q26 (‘27/’28 EBITDA up \~10%) and update our valuation approach by applying a 4x (vs 0x prior) EV/EBITDA premium to Chinese peers through ’27–’28 to reflect FSLR’s preferred regulatory positioning, while maintaining a 50/50 DCF and multiples-based approach.
* SYF -Synchrony Financial posted Q3 EPS of $2.86, beating estimates by $0.65, on $3.82B in revenue (vs $3.8B est). The board approved a $1B increase to its share repurchase authorization through June 2026, bringing the total available to $2.1B.
* UBER - Guggenheim intiates with Buy rating, PT 140.
* Our BUY thesis is underpinned by the company’s asset base consisting of industry-leading 1) network, 2) technology, and 3) brand equity.
* Uber’s multi-platform network is over 3x that of the next gig peer, with reach positioning the rideshare leader for increased Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption (i.e., ‘Big Wheels Keep on Turnin’). We believe the AV debate will remain a key driver of sentiment, with bulls highlighting market expansion potential and bears arguing disintermediation risk (we believe both will prove true; see Scenario Analysis on Page(s) 26–29 within).
* We expect AVs to account for 20% of overall U.S. rideshare by 2035E (international on a 5–10 year lag), with Uber’s industry-leading demand benefiting from increased AV supply.
* LYFT - Guggenheim initiates coverage with Buy rating, PT 22
* ""Our BUY rating reflects 1) recent Waymo and May Mobility partnerships (i.e., ‘Ticket to Ride’), 2) our view that consensus estimates underappreciate FREENOW contribution, and 3) Street Booking forecasts below management’s medium-term target.
* We expect the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) debate to remain a key sentiment driver, with bulls highlighting market expansion potential and bears arguing disintermediation (we believe both will prove true).

NSCALE - Will deploy 104,000 NVDA GB300 GPUs in a \~240 MW facility in Texas under a new agreement with MSFT opening in Q3 2026. The project is part of a broader contract totaling \~200,000 GPUs, spanning the U.S. and Europe
* GEV - Rothschild Redburn dwongrades to Sell from Neutral, PT 475. After much soul-searching and analysis, we conclude that GE Vernova’s current share price discounts a margin outlook that is implausibly positive in the long term, and we downgrade to Sell with a target price of $475.
* Catalysts for the Sell recommendation on GE Vernova to work are elusive amid thematic momentum, and timing is challenging. However, the gas turbine market has historically been highly variable and demand conditions for Siemens Energy’s and GE Vernova’s products reflect customer sentiment, i.e. ‘man-made’ forecasts of medium- and longer-term infrastructure requirements.
* These forecasts can change – indeed they just have, positively – and it would be dangerous to assume such optimism cannot reverse partially, especially given the highly unproven nature of the biggest single driver in the US: AI. 
* LVMH shares jumped after the luxury giant returned to sales growth for the 1ST time in three quarters.
* Q3 revenue rose 1% organically to €18.28B, topping forecasts. Fashion and leather goods fell a modest 2% vs expectations of a deeper drop. Sales in China rose 2% after a 9% decline in H1, while U.S. revenue climbed 3%.
* CFO Cécile Cabanis said trends are improving across divisions but cautioned that tougher comps in Q4 may limit near-term upside.

Is the top of this Pyramid Nvidia? 

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.

1o6zdti,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$GRRR - most undervalued AI play on the market,"Gorilla Technology (ticker: GRRR) could be the ONLY undervalued AI and data infrastructure stock in the entire market right with multi-bagger (2-5x) potential within the next few months. now especially with stocks like BBAI, RZLV, NBIS, APLD, IREN, CIFR, etc all up hundreds of % since April.

The company sits around a $400 million market cap, yet holds over $100 million in cash, has minimal debt (~$16M) , and recently announced a $1.4 billion contract in Singapore.

This isn’t a new startup trying to ride the AI wave. Gorilla has been around for more than twenty years, working with governments and major enterprises in AI, cybersecurity, and video analytics. They build the foundation that smart cities, national security systems, and AI-powered data centers run on.

⸻

⭐️What Makes GRRR Different

While companies like BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS have gained attention in the U.S., Gorilla has been quietly building dominance across Southeast Asia, particularly through government, security, and telecom contracts. Their AI-driven video analytics and infrastructure are already deployed in real national systems, not just in pilot phases.

Now they are expanding internationally, and that’s where things get even more interesting, because Gorilla is involved in a massive global initiative called One Amazon.

⸻

⭐️The One Amazon Project

One Amazon isn’t connected to Amazon the company. It’s a large international initiative focused on uniting AI, sustainability, and digital finance to protect and regenerate the Amazon rainforest. It’s backed and supported by major organizations and partners including the White House, Goldman Sachs, AECOM, Chainlink, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). These names alone show that this project isn’t just another idea, it’s a coordinated global effort.

What makes One Amazon especially interesting is its upcoming token launch, where each token represents one hectare of protected land. This gives it actual meaning, something that connects digital assets to real environmental impact. It’s not another meme coin or speculative token with no purpose. It’s meant to represent real-world sustainability value, linking financial markets directly to land conservation.

The global launch and full presentation of the project are expected to happen at COP30 next month, one of the world’s most important climate events. If successful, this could be far more meaningful than any of the hype tokens** out there, because it represents something tangible and beneficial.

Here’s where Gorilla comes in. Gorilla Technology is the primary technology provider for One Amazon, delivering the AI infrastructure, surveillance systems, and smart sensors that make the project possible. Their systems help monitor, protect, and manage the physical environments tied to the One Amazon token, ensuring transparency and security in how land and data are tracked.

In simple terms, Gorilla isn’t just associated with One Amazon, they’re building the core technology that connects the physical world to the digital one. If One Amazon scales as expected, Gorilla’s name could become a household name around the world.

There’s a video on the official One Amazon website that speaks volume about what this revolutionary project is about. I suggest everyone to go take a look.

⸻

⭐️2025 Guidance and Growth Outlook

Gorilla is giving strong guidance for 2025, signaling healthy growth ahead:

Revenue: Expected between $100 million and $110 million for the full year.
Adjusted EBITDA: Projected between $20 million and $25 million.
Gross Margin: Expected to be 40–45%.
Global Project Pipeline: Over $5 billion, with about $1 billion in contracts targeted for closure by mid-2026.
These numbers show Gorilla isn’t just relying on hype or a single project. They have a clear growth plan backed by a large pipeline, major partnerships, and solid fundamentals. That recent $105 million registered direct offering at an offering price of $17.50 per share (current stock price is $18.4 as of today Oct 04, 2025), which closed in July 2025 and was led by a major institutional investor, gave them over 100 million in cash to accelerate growth. This not only strengthens their balance sheet but also provides the resources needed to execute on contracts and expand globally.A $1.4 billion contract in Singapore alone dwarfs their current market cap, making these projections very exciting for long-term holders.

⸻

⭐️The Numbers Tell the Story

At a $400 million market cap, Gorilla already has over $100 million in cash and very little debt. Compare that with BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS, which already trade at significantly higher valuations despite being no where close in realizing their projected revenues yet.

That $1.4B Singapore contract alone is worth more than three times the company’s current market cap. Even if a fraction of it converts into revenue, it would dramatically shift Gorilla’s valuation metrics. On top of that, Gorilla was recently added to the S&P Global BMI Index, which could start attracting passive inflows and institutional attention.

⸻

⭐️Why I Think It’s Special

What stands out about Gorilla is that it’s not chasing headlines or trying to sell AI hype. They’re quietly building the infrastructure that other AI systems rely on. Their combination of strong balance sheet, government contracts, and global expansion positions them perfectly as demand for secure AI infrastructure continues to grow.

If the One Amazon project goes live as planned at COP30 and Gorilla’s role becomes more publicly recognized, the company could easily re-rate from a small-cap to a serious mid-cap within the next couple of years.

Yes, there’s still execution and volatility risk since it’s a smaller stock, but the combination of real contracts, credible partners, and meaningful global initiatives makes it feel like a hidden gem that the market hasn’t priced in yet.

⸻

⭐️Why the Market Hasn’t Caught On Yet

A big reason why GRRR is still so heavily discounted comes down to perception. It’s not a U.S. company, and most of its major customers are in Asia, which makes a lot of U.S. investors skeptical by default. People assume anything based in Asia with large government contracts can’t be fully trusted or verified, so the market automatically prices in a heavy “risk discount.”

There have also been fraud allegations floating around earlier this year from short-seller reports. But when you actually dig into the details, most of those claims have already been debunked or proven exaggerated. The accusations didn’t hold up once the company released more filings and clarified contract details. Despite the noise, no regulatory body has found any wrongdoing, and the company continues to sign new partnerships and win major government deals. Shorts have been taking massive advantage of this sentiment to suppress the stock price but the spring is fully coiled and it is likely going to go off very soon, particularly when Q3 earnings is released mid-Nov.

Then there’s CEO Jay Chandan. Some investors think he sounds too polished or too visionary to be real. He’s confident, ambitious, and talks about connecting AI, sustainability, and global infrastructure, which can sound like fluff to people used to hearing empty promises. But if you look at Gorilla’s actual results, long-term government contracts, real AI infrastructure deployments, and the One Amazon partnership, you start to see that there’s substance behind the story.

Jay also comes across as empathetic, articulate, and long-term focused. He’s not your typical small-cap CEO chasing hype. And the people around him give the company serious credibility. Dr. Raj Natarajan, Gorilla’s current CTO, previously spent years at Microsoft leading product and engineering teams, and Thomas Sennhauser, Intel’s current CTO and Business Lead for Asia-Pacific, recently joined Gorilla’s Board of Directors. Before Intel, Sennhauser spent nearly two decades at HPE in senior technical leadership roles. If you want to dive deeper in the company’s credibility, you can take a look at this post

Their core team includes engineers, AI researchers, and tech specialists who’ve been building advanced surveillance and infrastructure systems for more than two decades. This isn’t a new company trying to capitalize on AI hype, they’ve been quietly doing this work long before “AI infrastructure” became a buzzword.

So yes, skepticism makes sense, and some of the CEO’s confidence might sound over the top at times. But when you step back and look at the fundamentals, the leadership, and the confirmed contracts, the valuation just doesn’t add up. It’s a rare case where skepticism might be creating one of the biggest asymmetrical opportunities out there.

⸻

⭐️TL;DR

Gorilla Technology (GRRR) is sitting at a $400M market cap with over $100M in cash, minimal debt (~$16M) and a $1.4B contract already signed. The current stock price is does not reflect their fundamentals at all. They are deeply involved in the One Amazon initiative, which includes partners like the White House, Goldman Sachs, Chainlink, AECOM, and the IDB, and will officially launch at COP30 next month, which will provide MASSIVE exposure to Gorilla. The project’s token represents one hectare of land, making it one of the world’s first digital assets with true real-world meaning.

While everyone chases meme coins and overvalued AI stocks, Gorilla is quietly building the technology backbone for the future, combining surveillance, AI infrastructure, smart data centres, and sustainable finance to power real‑world projects on a global scale.

It will be one of those companies people will look back on and realize the potential was obvious all along.

njjbhk9,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Is Microsoft going to be effected in any long term way with Xbox basically trying to hang itself with a golden noose,"Console are loss leaders. Microsoft and Sony hardly make profit on consoles; they often lose money on console so they can lock you into their ecosystem. In November 2022, Phil Spencer said that Microsoft looses about $100-200 for every Xbox sold. 

They're sold near or below cost while games, subscriptions, DLC, and accessories are sold at markups for profit. (Nintendo does sell consoles for a profit, just different strategies.)

Getting rid of consoles would boost the profitability of the gaming division, benefitting Microsoft

Also, just by simply mathematics, boosting the gamepass subscription by 50% can only harm them if they lose 33% or more of customers. That's just not happening, and if it did, they can always just reverse it. Gamepass is still a great deal if you use it a lot, and Microsoft knows how to price things properly.

1o6qrdt,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon,"Let's first set aside the fact that every valuation metric is nearing their most historically elevated levels. Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. 

But even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. 

Valuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market ""has"" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. 

So while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. 

Here's why I don't expect a crash. 

>***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** 

>\~ Peter Lynch

I think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. 

In 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. 

In 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. 

Today, just look at the market. Look at the S&P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low. Interest coverage ratios are well within historical bounds ([Goldman Sachs: Exhibit 11](https://www.goldmansachs.com/ayco/materials/isg-content/ISG-impact-of-rising-rates-on-corporate-debt-us-equities.pdf) & [JPM: Page 13](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf)). And these should only improve as rates come down. 

And yes, the Mag 7 make up 30% of the index. But even if the market grew a conscience tomorrow and re-rated the Mag 7 down by 40%, that only represents a 12% decline in the market. 

***The system isn't static.***

>I owned META in 2022 when it was trading at single digit PE levels. I sold it on the basis that the metaverse was a business endeavor that was a destruction in value. They were burning so much cash on it.

>Later that year, Zuck announced that they were scaling back investment on that project, and the rest was history. I never bought back in.

>This is an important lesson when looking at the current state of fiscal policy. We shouldn’t anchor to the 30% global tariffs and 130% tariffs on iPhones. As policy changes, we should update our valuation assumptions with it. I do think we should be cognizant of how unhinged and random the administration is with trade policy, and perhaps ‘some’ extra risk premium should be applied to the market to account for it, but we probably shouldn’t expect some massive repricing event right now.

>Yes, tariffs are still on, but the 10% range is something that is much more palatable for US businesses and consumers.

>Also, the walk-back in policy this past week does signal that the POTUS put is in play. Donald does care what markets are doing.

>\~ [Me, April 12th, 2025](https://substack.com/@riskpremium/note/c-108294047?r=1r289e&utm_source=notes-share-action&utm_medium=web)

This lesson extends to AI capex as well. There's nothing that says that if AI isn't working out that all these companies have to stick with those projects. And the outcome is net zero. Whatever cash comes off of Nvidia's CF statement only lifts the bottom line for the other constituents. So sure, Nvidia probably gets hammered. But it only helps the other companies' bottom lines. That's not to say Microsoft and Google, et. al won't get hurt. There's a lot of potential energy stored in these AI projects. But if the market deems AI as a money-loser, I can only imagine the market will cheer if they pare back on AI projects. 

***There still is some bubble behavior.*** 

With all that being said, there are some pockets of the market that do worry me. Companies like Oklo, Quantumscape, Joby are all pricing in the prospects of a very different future. And that's usually a bad bet. I'm also seeing companies like Solid Power being resurrected from the dead despite having no product, no potential of a product, and on no news. That stock is up almost 7-fold off the lows. These are just a few of the stocks that I follow; you probably personally see it in your own areas of interest. But we're still no where near the levels of euphoria that we saw in late 2020 / early 2021 where ARK funds were a ""sure thing"" and NFTs were auctioning for millions. That's the level of behavior that I think I want to see before I got worried about euphoria. 

And yes, tariffs worry me, and the prospect of a trade war worries me. But again, the system is dynamic. There's really nothing that says tariffs = recession in the same way that Covid didn't equal a global financial meltdown. 

***Summary***

I don't think I see a path to a stock market washout, just yet. 2021 & 2000 are the models for euphoria. 2008 is the model for financial irresponsibility. We currently have neither. AI probably is a bubble, but I also don't think we're pricing in some manic level of optimism there either. Maybe if we get to a point where AI tokens become a line item on balance sheets, then I'll start to worry. We're not there yet.  

That's not to say there isn't excess we could work off, though. And if you're scared of a 20% - 30% correction, that's perfectly okay. It's probably just a sign that you're not positioned correctly for your risk tolerance. I'm not full equities, and I'm certainly no where near 100% US stocks. ***In a world where investors are going increasingly risk-on, it makes sense to take your foot off the pedal.*** But we also shouldn't let the prospect of a 25% correction shake us out of the markets completely. To end with another Peter Lynch quote: 

>***Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.***

 **ARM's partnership with OpenAI:**

* OpenAI is teaming up with SoftBank’s ARM to design a CPU that will work alongside its upcomingBroadcom-built AI chip, according to The Information.  
* The Arm CPU is intended to handle more general computing tasks in tandem with GPUs, while the OpenAI–Broadcom chip will focus on AI inference workloads, with production expected to begin in late 2026.  The chips will be manufactured by TSMC, and both companies are testing early samples now. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also urging TSMC to expand capacity to meet demand for OpenAI’s growing AI factory network.  
* OpenAI plans to use the new chips to power part of its $1 trillion AI data center buildout, targeting 26 GW of capacity by 2033. The company expects up to 10 GW of compute to come from Broadcom chips between 2026 and 2029.



  
MAg7:

* NVDA - AVGO's launching Thor Ultra, a new networking chip that doubles the bandwidth of its predecessor to scale up AI data-center networks. The chip will compete directly with NVDA's networking interfaces as Broadcom targets a $60–90 billion AI market by 2027. 
* GOOGL - TO INVEST $15 BILLION IN INDIA AI HUB
* NVDA - has started shipping its new DGX Spark desktop AI supercomputer, capable of 1 petaflop of performance and 128GB of unified memory.  CEO Jensen Huang personally delivered the 1st unit to Elon Musk at SpaceX’s Starbase in Texas, echoing his 2016 handoff of the DGX-1 to OpenAI. 
* AAPL - said iPhone Air pre-orders will open in China this Friday, Oct 17, after Chinese telecom operators received approval to offer eSIM services.

  
OTHER COMPANIES:

* ON CRYPTO: BLACKROCK'S CEO SAYS BLACKROCK'S CEO ESTIMATES MORE THAN $4.5 TRILLION IN VALUE IS CURRENTLY HELD IN DIGITAL WALLETS ACROSS CRYPTO, STABLECOINS, AND TOKENIZED ASSETS, EXPECT MARKET TO EXPAND RAPIDLY
* ORCL, AMD - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will add 50,000 AMD GPUs starting in H2 2026, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in AI. Oracle expects strong customer demand, especially for inferencing.
* WOLFE SEES $300 AMD STOCK ON OPENAI DEAL  Wolfe Research upgraded AMD to Outperform with a $300 target, citing strong upside from its OpenAI partnership and rising server demand.
* FSLR - Citi raised PT to a street high of 300 from 198, maintains Buy rating. Citi expects 3Q EPS to beat guidance on stronger pricing and mix, noting robust U.S. bookings, data center–driven demand, and Section 232 tariff clarity could lift shares. Citi also cited strong cash flow and low beta, though noted uncertainty from a potential 25% India tariff.
* AVGO - is launching Thor Ultra, a new networking chip that doubles the bandwidth of its predecessor to scale up AI data-center networks. The chip will compete directly with NVDA's networking interfaces as Broadcom targets a $60–90 billion AI market by 2027. 
* NET -  partnered with Visa, Mastercard, and Amex to develop authentication for AI shopping agents using its Web Bot Auth protocol. The system secures agent-based transactions and prevents bot fraud. Other partners include Microsoft, Shopify, Circle, and Coinbase.
* IREN - Cantor Fitzgerald raises PT to 100 from 49. While shares have performed well amid expectations that IREN will focus entirely on its GPU cloud, we continue to believe there is more room to run. To illustrate this, we outline a scenario in which IREN uses all of its energized capacity for its GPU Cloud.  On a contracted megawatt basis, we still see IREN trading at roughly a 75% discount to its neocloud peer group. While we acknowledge a discount is warranted today due to differences in revenue backlog, we expect this gap to narrow over time, driving a material re-rating in IREN shares.  We continue to believe that all hyperscalers and major AI labs remain materially short on compute capacity, which places IREN in a unique position given its land, power, access to capital, and data center expertise
* PLTR - Piper Sandler raises PT to 201 from 182. There is no argument that PLTR’s valuation leaves no margin for error, particularly if any signs of moderating growth emerge. However, we argue that with tremendous visibility on future revenue (over $7 billion of defined contract value plus an estimated \~$4 billion of IDIQ contract value), accelerating triple-digit growth in commercial bookings year-to-date, and an unparalleled wallet share opportunity across $1 trillion of U.S. defense spending — which could allow PLTR to 2–3x its current government business and still be 10x smaller than the largest defense primes — PLTR has not reached peak growth.
* NVAX - Shah Capital, which holds a 7.2% stake in Novavax and is its second-largest shareholder, is urging the company’s board to pursue a sale, Reuters reports.
* GM - will take a $1.6B charge in Q3 to realign its EV production strategy amid weaker demand and policy shifts. The charge includes $1.2B in non-cash impairments and $0.4B in contract cancellations as GM reassesses its EV and battery investments, citing slower adoption after U.S. tax credit cuts.
* DIS - has considered naming Dana Walden and Josh D’Amaro as co-CEOs to replace Bob Iger, according to CNBC. Both are frontrunners for the CEO role, with an announcement expected in early 2026.
* Goldman initiated coverage on US healthcare companies. Buy on UNH, CI, CVS, ALHC. Neutral on MOH, ELV, OSCR. Sell on CNC, HUM
* BE - Jefferies, PT of 31, so very bearish. Said they “We Would Still Need to See Substantial Backlog Adds to Alleviate 2027 Outlook Concerns”
* MU -  Samsung Electronics expects Q3 operating profit of ₩12.1T ($8.5B), up 32% YoY and its highest since 2022, on stronger DRAM and NAND demand from AI-related investments.
* DLO - Goldman upgrades to Buy from neutral, raises PT to 19 from 12. We upgrade shares of dLocal to Buy from Neutral, as we have greater confidence it can deliver 20%+ EBITDA growth in the mid-term. We raise our price target to $19 from $12, implying 40% upside from current levels.  We expect solid total payment volume (TPV) growth through 2027, supported by:  1. Successful geographical diversification; 2. Gaining share with existing merchants; and 3. Attracting new merchants, such as stablecoin operators.
*  VRT - advanced its 800V DC platform with NVIDIA to power next-gen AI factories. The system targets megawatt-scale racks and will roll out in 2H 2026, aligned with NVIDIA’s Rubin Ultra launch. 
* NVTS - said its next-gen GaN and SiC power chips will support NVIDIA’s new 800V DC architecture for AI data centers. The 800V system replaces legacy 54V designs, improving efficiency, cutting copper use, and boosting reliability across large-scale AI infrastructure.

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop. 

Just an example : EU can't find Germanium for their defense sector

Trump can literally tweet and crash the entire market. But that is not even the worst part. People noticed that about 30 minutes before Trump’s tweet, someone shorted Bitcoin and made 88 million dollars.

Are we entering times when money and stocks have literally no value?

It has always seemed to me that when I invest in a stock, I am supposedly buying part of a company. But suddenly, if everything stops working and the world is burning, it has literally no value.

I think Trump is manipulating the stock market and turning investing into a casino, something that does not make sense and is not based on real value, because his tweets can crash the market.

I guess we are entering times when the value of the dollar and paper money will decrease. They can regulate the dollar’s value by printing more money or cutting interest rates. It is the same with stocks. Influential people, those around big companies and politics, are doing insider trading and you cannot stop them.

When I buy any stock for 10 000 dollars, I do not feel like I am buying something valuable or safe. I feel like I am giving away my money with the fear that I might not get it back for nothing. Honestly, if I buy Nvidia stock for 10 000 dollars, am I really part of that company? Do they treat me with respect? No. I am just giving them money, hoping to grab a small piece of the cake and sell the stock for a gain, money I can later exchange for real assets like food or a home.

These stocks are useless. They are basically a scam, but it works, so we all play the game.

I think the stock market is evil. It is a way to multiply money easily, as if money is poured into a void. If the stock market did not exist, people would invest their money into creating businesses, building houses, manufacturing, and production that actually create tangible returns, real value, not something made from thin air.

You may agree or not, but it is the truth. I hate that I also play this game, because it gives me money, yet there is so little real value in it.
As I said, I buy top company stocks like Nvidia and Oracle. And what does that mean? Nothing. I do not own anything. I am just a small player that does not matter to those companies, a mouse trying to grab a crumb and run away.

If the whole market tanked and I was left with those stocks, they would be useless, as useless as paper money that can be easily manipulated.

Bitcoin was supposed to be the asset resistant to financial manipulation. But it is a meme asset, one tweet from Musk can move it.

I think Trump hates the stock market and manipulates it with his tweets to push people into investing in real value, manufacturing, new businesses, infrastructure, food, and housing.

I think that might be the future. Paper money will devalue, stocks will become worthless paper, and real value will lie in tangible assets homes, skills, art, people, food, and manufacturing.


I think Trump is tanking the stock market because it is his way of bringing manufacturing back to America to be able to compete with China.
Rich billionaires pour their money into stocks and create no real value. They just multiply money without effort or producing anything of real worth.
The stock market has a huge influence on the small amount of manufacturing left in America. If I did not have money in the stock market, I would be happy to see that flawed system crash to the bottom.
Buying stocks is not true investing. You do not produce any value.


I'm poor, but I give away my money to financially support billion dollar companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and others. This is so ridiculous.

I think if the dollar devalued or if the stock market tanked, it could actually be positive for society. People forget that stocks and money are just useless paper that don’t improve your life. Real value lies in tangible assets: homes, properties, medications, people, connections, metals, gold, copper, coal, wood, water, and so on.

If no money existed, we would all hoard in other words, invest in water, toilet paper, wood, trees, coal, petrol, milk, fruits, food, homes, and other tangible resources.

And that is how it should be. It would reduce poverty if everyone focused on producing tangible assets instead of paper stocks.

There are enough resources for everyone to have a house and food. But evil people invented the stock market and paper money and made us believe it had real value, blocking access to the resources we need to survive. If everyone had houses and food, no one would work for companies nine to five their whole life until retirement. That's why they need the stock market. It's basically a black hole to throw your extra money into a void that doesn’t produce any value, keeping the poor poor and making them constantly work for rich. 

A stock market crash and dollar devaluation could actually be good for society because it would shift focus toward producing real value.


That's why, if we want to fight billionaires and work toward being truly rich( having a home, food, and not working our whole lives as slaves )we have to ditch paper money. Billionaires control us with it. Working people should not touch money billionaires touch and have separate currency. Instead, we should pay with real value,  skill for skill. I stand for a system where you do something for me, I do something for you, in exchange  like it worked naturally in ancient times.

Toilet paper has more real value than the stocks I hold.

In a monetary system crisis, I would hoard toilet paper because it is more valuable than 100 virtual shares of some company,  they may generate profit or not, but my ultimate goal is to sell those stocks, exchange them for money, and buy assets like toilet paper that improve my life.",Ok_Music_2025,0,0.48,62.0,2025-10-11 21:18:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o448dp/paper_money_and_stocks_have_no_real_value_nowadays/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o448dp/paper_money_and_stocks_have_no_real_value_nowadays/

niwyesx,comment,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft enterprise moat looking stronger while trading at discount to software peers,"How much profit is being made on AI? Not what Nvidia are doing, or Microsoft are doing, but people using Midjounrney, Anthropic, OpenAI? All those companies have VC sugardaddies spending money on them, making them look really good. But they aren't doing it for nothing. Sugar daddies want the sugar, and at some point, when hype is at peak, will dump them.

And you completely fail to understand the difference between host and enterprise stack. Yes, rewriting your .net/C# application into Python/Postgres is a considerable undertaking, But the stack isn't tied into the host. You can run a .net application anywhere. You just need Windows servers, or certain types of services which providers have. Like Azure has App Service, AWS has Elastic Beanstalk. They basically do the same thing. Shifting from one to the other takes some planning but it isn't that hard. There's lots of companies, and parts of government running the Microsoft .net stack on AWS, or Google Cloud, or all manner of other hosts and clouds (Oracle, IBM, Alibaba, STACKIT).

Now, Microsoft do make it slicker. The integration of Azure with Devops is sweet. But it isn't that big a thing. And you pay a little more for Azure over AWS.",Teembeau,1,,,2025-10-11 11:28:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o35vlr/microsoft_enterprise_moat_looking_stronger_while/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o35vlr/microsoft_enterprise_moat_looking_stronger_while/niwyesx/
niwu9t0,comment,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"MAG 7 - Direction towards earnings call and long term hold, which way to go?","I am quite nervous about the AI bubble. Everything is pointing that way. And they'll all be hit when it happens, even Meta and Google which aren't running on hype.

At the top, you have unprofitable private AI companies.

These companies pay the likes of Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Amazon for hosting (not sure which and by how much, but Oracle is doing a lot for OpenAI).

Those companies pay Nvda and AMD for chips to go in their warehouses.

Now, those private AI companies are losing money. They're being propped up by VC companies. The same sort of VC companies that were raving about the potential of Snap and other tech nonsense. They pour money in, build the hype, then go IPO and that's when they profit. It repays all the ludicrous spending.

Those VC companies aren't going to keep shovelling money in forever. They're going to wait until the hype is at max and dump it. And I don't think we're far from that point. So then, you have investors holding shares who want a profit. Which isn't going to come soon. Do they keep doing what Sam Altman wants and pumping in trillions into chips, or start asking for cost cutting? And then what happens to Oracle? 

For me (and maybe I'm wrong), best case is already more than priced into most of these companies. And that's before we get into things like rival chips and hosting out of China. Meta and Google still look good. I think AI is ultimately js going to just be part of search, and Google will wipe out OpenAI. But an AI crash could have a short term hit on both. Personally, I would wait for that event and buy cheap.

Tesla is a dog with fleas. Absolute garbage. Avoid.

Apple I just don't know. I feel like phones are so generic, might as well go Android. It's a company that got as big as it did on innovation and I see almost zero successful innovation.",Teembeau,6,,,2025-10-11 10:42:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o36omg/mag_7_direction_towards_earnings_call_and_long/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o36omg/mag_7_direction_towards_earnings_call_and_long/niwu9t0/

For better or for worse.

That isn't to say AMZN is a bad company to own, but rather their business model is so vastly different than the others.

And look I get AWS is a gem of a business, but as long as AWS is tied to the hip with a bloated retail enterprise, I will continue to invest elsewhere for cloud technology. I would not be shocked at all if AWS splits from AMZN if the company continues to tread water valuation wise for the next few years.",SouthIsland48,0,0.43,36.0,2025-10-10 20:46:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o39e0q/days_like_today_are_a_reminder_that_amzn_is_not/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o39e0q/days_like_today_are_a_reminder_that_amzn_is_not/

This is the reason I continue to hold Microsoft"".  

As a software engineer working with AI and cloud computing I tend to agree with what is said here.

Some things to consider (also to help reduce my confirmation bias)

Potential weaknesses overall:
Dependence on Enterprise Clients – Heavy reliance on corporate and institutional customers can slow innovation and make growth cyclical.

Lag in Consumer Hardware – Surface and mobile efforts (e.g., Windows Phone legacy) have not achieved mass-market success.

High Operating Costs – Intense investment in AI, data centers, and acquisitions strains margins.

Economic Slowdowns – Corporate IT budget cuts could affect software subscriptions and cloud growth.

Rapid Tech Shifts – If Microsoft fails to keep pace in AI, quantum computing, or new platforms, it could lose leadership.",ProfByronBrainard,4,,,2025-10-10 19:47:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o35vlr/microsoft_enterprise_moat_looking_stronger_while/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o35vlr/microsoft_enterprise_moat_looking_stronger_while/nit60l7/

1o35vlr,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft enterprise moat looking stronger while trading at discount to software peers,"Been digging into Microsoft's positioning in the enterprise AI space and the value proposition seems compelling. Recent CIO surveys show they're consistently winning IT wallet share against competitors, with strong preference for their integrated ecosystem from productivity tools through cloud infrastructure. The interesting part is Azure keeps beating growth expectations while the stock trades at a meaningful discount to the broader software sector multiples.

What stands out is the sustainability of the competitive advantage. The switching costs from their enterprise stack are substantial, and they're focusing on high-value clients rather than chasing every deal. Their approach of prioritizing capacity allocation to customers with better economics suggests disciplined capital deployment. For a company with this kind of enterprise moat, steady execution, and trading below sector averages, it seems like the market might be underpricing the durability of their position.

One solution would be IPO, but there are serious roadblocks against it due to Open AI's hybrid structure of non-profit and PBC, Microsoft's influence, and regulatory challenges.

1o2gfpp,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"
With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

 

Notable:

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48
4 Companies from 1999 had a positive return through 2006. 
5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

1o2b1hk,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,What to Invest in with a Joint Account?,"Hi All, 

Looking on some ideas/advice of where to invest in a joint account with my wife. 

Little Background. 

My wife has a 401k through her employer

I have a state pension and a Roth IRA that I invest heavily into VOO and I have a large chunk of NVDA, some Amazon, MSFT, and a little PEG.

My Wife and I are saving upwards of $4k every month and I want to take a chunk of that and invest in a joint account so our money works for us a little more.

Do I just invest in more VOO or do invest in a different ETF, go Dividend heavy, or something else all together? 

I feel like VOO would be ok but that doesn't give us much diversity in our portfolio. 

What would you do? 

Thanks all! ",AntiMatter89,3,0.8,5.0,2025-10-09 18:44:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2b1hk/what_to_invest_in_with_a_joint_account/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2b1hk/what_to_invest_in_with_a_joint_account/
1o24xpj,post,Daytrading,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,All the market moving news from premarket summarised in one short report,"MAG7:

* NVDA - Cantor Fitzgerald raises PT to 300 from 240, which is a new Street High. A particular spotlight during this trip was the company’s new partnership with OpenAI, where they aim to stand it up as its own self-hosted hyperscaler. The vision is to remove margin stacking by server ODMs and CSPs, narrowing the cost delta between NVDA and ASICs to only around 15%—a win-win for both and a potential source of further pressure on the ASIC market. NVIDIA continues to work at Extreme Co-Design on an annual cadence, optimizing the entire AI infrastructure through a full-stack solution including CUDA-X.
* Put simply, Jensen and the team are as focused and competitive as ever, and they are playing to win. We do not see a scenario where NVDA fails to secure at least 75% of the AI accelerator market over time. Following three days of meetings, our confidence in both the growth of AI infrastructure and NVIDIA’s market share through the 2030 timeframe has increased considerably.
* GOOGL just launched Gemini Enterprise, its new agentic AI platform built to compete with Microsoft and OpenAI. The platform unifies Google’s latest Gemini models, a no-code workbench, customizable business agents, and a secure data layer, all managed under one governance system for tracking and auditing.
* TSLA - NHTSA opens probe into TSLA over traffic violations using FSD — roughly 2.9M vehicles under review for reports of Teslas driving through traffic lights.
* META - Rayban maker sees SMART GLASSES AS THE NEXT SMARTPHONE    NVDA - has confirmed it will use Samsung’s 5th-gen HBM3E 12-high memory in its upcoming GB300 AI accelerator, according to News1.
* NVDA - The US has approved several billion dollars worth of NVDA chip exports to the UAE under a new AI partnership deal. 
* MSFT - is developing its own AI models to reduce reliance on OpenAI and strengthen its Copilot ecosystem.   Microsoft’s AI division, led by Mustafa Suleyman, has expanded staffing and aims to train in-house models capable of replacing OpenAI workloads over time.



DAL earnings:



* Revenue: $15.20B (Est. $15.04B) ; UP +4.1% YoY
* EPS: $1.71 (Est. $1.53) ; UP +14% YoY  

Raises FY25 Outlook:

*  EPS: ≈$6.00 (Est. $5.77) 
* Free Cash Flow: $3.5–$4.0B
*  Gross Leverage: <2.5x  

Q4’25 Outlook

*  Revenue: UP +2%–4% YoY

CEO Commentary — Ed Bastian

*  “We delivered September quarter results at the top end of our expectations on strong execution and improving fundamentals.”
*  “Momentum is continuing into the final stretch of our Centennial year, positioning us to deliver strong December quarter earnings.”
*  “Looking to 2026, Delta is well positioned to deliver top-line growth, margin expansion, and earnings improvement consistent with our long-term framework.” 

CFO Commentary — Dan Janki

* “Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat compared to prior year, consistent with our full-year guidance.”
*  “We’ve paid down nearly $2B in debt year-to-date, bringing gross leverage to 2.4x.”
*  “Full-year free cash flow of $3.5–$4B enables us to reinvest in the business while returning cash to shareholders.”    

OTHER COMPANIES:

* RARE EARTH NAMES: China  will implement new export controls on rare earths starting December 1, requiring exporters to obtain dual-use licenses and disclose the final end-user and destination details. Exports tied to weapons of mass destruction will be strictly prohibited.
* GAP - announced a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud to integrate Gemini, Vertex AI, and BigQuery across its brands (Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta).The deal aims to accelerate product design, pricing, and planning through AI tools, deliver hyper-personalized shopping experiences, and empower employees with AI-driven decision support.
* DIS - is RAISING ticket prices at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland, citing higher labor costs and park expansions. At Disneyland, the top-tier one-day ticket now costs $224, up $18, while the five-day Park Hopper rose to $655.  Annual passes climbed to as high as $1,899, and parking fees increased by $5.
* SERV, DASH - DoorDashis teaming up with Serve Robotics in a multiyear deal to roll out sidewalk delivery robots across the US, starting in Los Angeles.
* DOCN - Canaccord raises PT to 55 from 49. Rates it as a buy. Yes, we’re still clearly in 'show me, don’t tell me' territory, but it’s for that reason we love the setup. In a software market often divorced from fundamentals, DOCN shares have room to move materially higher (even double over 2 years) if growth reverts back closer to market growth levels in the high teens, driven by a budding AI inference opportunity paired with a steady up-current in core cloud.
* Our view is that this is not a head fake but the early makings of a classic business turnaround, which have been some of the most rewarding stories for us to cover as analysts.
* NVO - TO BUY AKERO THERAPEUTICS AKRO FOR $54 A SHARE IN CASH
* RACE -  laid out its 2030 roadmap at Capital Markets Day, confirming an average of four new model launches per year between 2026 and 2030 and the debut of its first fully electric Ferrari elettrica in late 2026. 
* DKNG - Berenberg upgrades DKNG to Buy from Hold, lowers PT to 43 from 45. 
* HOOD - Citizens raises PT to 170 from 130. Market outperform. Given the strong stock move, we believe the direction of earnings is fairly well known (expectation for a strong quarter), but this has been a continual 'beat-and-raise' story, and we still see many aspects of earnings upside over the next couple of years that are barely in models at this point — suggesting to us that momentum can continue even if not on a straight line.""
* COIN - Citizens reiterates market outperform on COIN, PT 440. We estimate Coinbase should deliver an improved 'core' third-quarter result versus the second quarter, but the GAAP headline will again be noisy. Specifically, results will include a markdown from its ownership in CRCL given the lower share price in the quarter, offset by a mark-up on gains tied to balance-sheet crypto assets.  DraftKings has sold off materially following the threat of disruption from prediction markets, and given the group lacks international exposure, it has been most affected. While we acknowledge risks from prediction markets, we have seen no impact on numbers so far. Additionally, there is still opacity as to how much crossover exists with legal betting markets and customer databases, and the legality of the product is far from certain. As a result, we think the sell-off is overdone.
* OKLO - Canaccord Genuity initiates with Buy rating PT 175. The world needs greater supplies of clean, baseload power; while rising AI demand may influence the growth trajectory, we anticipate strong long-term demand for nuclear energy regardless. Set against this backdrop of likely extraordinary momentum, a new wave of energy leaders is beginning to take shape—each poised to leave its own distinctive mark. And we see Oklo emerging as one; a vertically integrated, global distributed nuclear energy utility—breaking down barriers by closing the loop.""
* BE - HSBC downgrades to Hold from Buy, raises PT to 100 from 44. Our USD100.00 TP implies 14.2% upside, and we downgrade to Hold from a Buy rating previously. While we see tremendous upside for the company and expect consensus estimates to revise higher, we await a better entry point for the shares
* TSMC - TSMC Q3 revenue totaled NT$989.9B, above consensus NT$973.3B, while YTD revenue reached NT$2.76T, up 36.4% YoY, though marking the 2nd straight month of decelerating growth pace
* BABA - PT lowered to $240 from $245 at JPMorgan
* BABA - PT raised to 200 from 195 at BofA
* APLD - Applied Digital price target raised to $35 from $18 at Citizens JMP",TearRepresentative56,0,0.5,0.0,2025-10-09 14:45:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1o24xpj/all_the_market_moving_news_from_premarket/,https://reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1o24xpj/all_the_market_moving_news_from_premarket/

I’m considering switching from all ETFs in my Roth IRA to some Magnificent 7 stocks such as TSLA, NVDA, GOOGL, AAPL, META, MSFT. They would be all new holdings. Then I would write monthly covered calls to collect premiums as described in my table.

Upside $8k give or take monthly. Downsides some stocks get massive upside and I miss out on huge gains. Another downside is we hit 🐻territory and account value dumps, but I can still write CCs right, albeit with lower premiums available.

1o1ftxv,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,YOLO on $AI,"Pray for me.

EDIT: **DD: $AI (C3.ai) – Why I’m Bullish**

**Price Context:**  
Current Price: \~$19  
52-Week Range: $14.7 – $45

# 1️⃣ Strategic Partnerships Driving Growth

[C3.ai](http://C3.ai) has locked in some heavyweight partners that could accelerate enterprise adoption:

* **Microsoft**: Preferred enterprise AI partner – huge reach.
* **AWS & Google Cloud**: Strong cloud infrastructure + co-selling.
* **McKinsey QuantumBlack**: Combining AI expertise with consulting muscle – serious enterprise credibility.

These partnerships are not just logos; they’re pipeline multipliers.

# 2️⃣ Financial & Business Model Tailwinds

* **Subscription revenue = 86% of total revenue** → strong recurring cash flow.
* **Shift to consumption-based SaaS** → revenue scales with client usage, aligning incentives and improving financial stability.
* **Cash > Debt** → buffer against AI hype swings and market volatility.

Basically, the company has a runway to execute without burning out.

# 3️⃣ Market Opportunity

* Enterprise AI adoption is still in **early innings**.
* [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) targets **industry-specific AI apps**, not generic AI tools – harder to displace and sticky revenue.
* Big enterprise names trust their platform – the network effect matters.

# 4️⃣ Risk vs. Reward

* **Current Price = Lower risk entry point** (50%+ from 52-week high).
* Short-term execution hiccups exist (pilot conversions, margins), but these are normal growing pains in enterprise AI.
* CEO & leadership transitions could be uncertainty, but also opportunity if new strategies stick.

Bottom line: downside is somewhat contained at current valuations; upside is huge if enterprise AI adoption accelerates.

# 5️⃣ Why Now

* Price has already retraced massively → good risk/reward.
* Strategic partnerships & McKinsey deal signal **enterprise confidence**.
* Market volatility = opportunity for patient bulls.

**TL;DR:**  
[C3.ai](http://C3.ai) is a **low-risk entry** for bulls who believe in enterprise AI. Partnerships, recurring revenue, and consumption-based SaaS are strong tailwinds.

1o18pxg,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

[Just like your mom, it's desperate to have it's gap filled](https://preview.redd.it/bh4w96fiqvtf1.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a8460f055ec3041c6e75824cc2ec74413ff3e6)

**Share ownership:** 76% of shares owned by institutions

https://preview.redd.it/ofp8arvgovtf1.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1de3ea3e0d5a8d125815002c1f75924d255d711

**Ziptrader** (800k subs on youtube) made PATH his #1 pick

**My Position:** November, December, and January calls + shares. Planning to add more, as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks. I'm using my gambling account, and I got permission from my wife's boyfriend to use her account and start another position.

https://preview.redd.it/be5wwo5povtf1.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=085f819ce6466761de9a6600b021287e5ed6ef1d

**TLDR: PATH is an established player in AI and Robotics, has signed major deals with NVDA, openAI, CRM, SNOW, and MSFT, but the stock price has not reflected their potential growth. PT: 50+**

  
**UPDATE: 10/15/2025**

Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on 10/10/25 Made me take profit on November/December calls. Up $30k

Still Holding January Calls below, and shares. Will look to add to position again as market recovers:

But let me add some detail to this...

They're looking at the P/E of Microsoft and Amazon. Fine. There are two sides to Microsoft and Amazon. There's a good, stable business. Licensing software, selling you USB leads, and some boring old cloud hosting. Then there's a prediction based on their cloud growth. Like there is around half of Oracle price that is not dependant on AI. They still sell boring old licenses for databases and some enterprise software.

Also, they're using Forward P/Es that are based on it continuing to grow and we just do not know that. What happens when OpenAI floats and people start demanding it make profits rather than burning money?

I would also go as far as to say that one indicator of a bubble is people writing things saying ""it's not a bubble"". Goldman aren't writing this for fun, or to be helpful to you.

1o15sk2,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles,"People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.

And recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

1o0xdqd,post,options,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$MSFT unusual options activity,"Alright so check this out… Yesterday, someone just dropped over $18M on MSFT 525 puts expiring Nov 14. That’s 10,000+ contracts at an average of $17.58, which is wild considering that strike is way out of the money right now.

Now, I’m holding the 555 calls for Oct 17, so I’m still on the bullish side short-term, but this kind of flow definitely caught my eye. When you see that kind of premium size and open interest this low (OI only 12), that means these are new positions, not some roll-over. Somebody’s loading up for a possible pullback or they’re hedging size ahead of next month.

If you look at the timing, this trade came in heavy right around noon yesterday. Big block order, probably an institution or fund putting protection in. Could be nothing more than a hedge on long tech exposure, but it could also mean someone’s anticipating a decent-sized correction once earnings or macro data hit.

I’m not changing my 555C plan yet, momentum’s still holding for now, but if I start seeing open interest stack up on these deep puts and volume confirming downside, I’ll probably flip or hedge. For now, I’m just watching if this turns into a chain reaction setup or just a whale hedge move. Attached is my charting for the daily and the screenshot from UW.

1o0ja1l,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$POET - Someone Just Dropped $75M In and Won't Say Who (We Find Out Oct 17),"Alright so I've been digging into this POET Technologies thing because of that dumb fuck who keeps posting shit about them in the DDs so I said what the hell I'll take a look.

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

1o0fzum,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,NEOV - Energy storage play with data center and commercial tailwinds,"Bought 400 shares at $5.20 today after doing some research. Another small cap burning cash, but the revenue growth is real and the market timing looks solid.

**The basics:**
- They make home and commercial battery storage systems (think Tesla Powerwall competitors)
- Revenue grew 219% last year to $8.4M
- Q4 alone was up 720% YoY 
- Just launched a 250kW/430kWh commercial system

**Why I'm bullish on the sector:**

Data centers are exploding with AI demand, and they're absolutely destroying local grids. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all scrambling for power solutions. Battery storage isn't optional anymore - it's infrastructure.

Peak shaving is becoming critical. Commercial facilities are getting hammered with demand charges (sometimes 50%+ of their electric bill). A battery system that shaves peak usage can pay for itself in 3-5 years just from utility savings.

The real opportunity is commercial/industrial, not residential. A single data center or manufacturing facility can deploy multiple megawatts of storage. That's where NEOV's new 250kW system comes in - stackable, modular, aimed at this exact market.

**Why NEOV specifically:**

CEO is ex-Tesla energy (Ardes Johnson) who launched the Powerwall partner program. He joined in April 2024 and revenue has exploded since - not just promises, actual sales growth.

They got added to the S&P Global BMI Index, signed 10% of Texas solar installers in one quarter, and have part one approval on a $250M DOE loan for domestic manufacturing.

The shift to commercial/industrial is smart. Higher margins, bigger deals, recurring service revenue. Every warehouse, factory, and data center is evaluating storage right now.

**The risks:**

They have $800K cash and burn about $5M/year. Dilution is coming, probably in the next 1-3 months. No way around it.

Gross margins are only 18%. They're growing revenue fast but still losing money. This is a scale play - betting they can grow into profitability before the cash runs out.

Competition is real - Tesla, Enphase, and others are all fighting for this market.

**My thesis:**

Energy storage demand is accelerating faster than supply. Data centers, EVs, grid instability, renewable integration - every trend points to massive battery deployment over the next 5 years.

NEOV is small enough to grow fast but has legitimate technology and distribution. The revenue growth isn't fake - distributors are placing multi-million dollar orders.

**Position management:**

This is a swing trade, not a retirement account play. 400 shares I can afford to lose completely.

Stop loss around $3.80 (-27%). If dilution happens and terms are reasonable, I'll consider averaging down.

Taking profits at $7 (25% of position) and $9 (another 25%), letting the rest ride.

**TL;DR:** Energy storage company with real revenue growth (219% YoY), ex-Tesla CEO executing, targeting the commercial/data center market at the right time. Major cash flow issues mean dilution is coming. High risk, but the sector tailwinds are undeniable.

1nzu2t4,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Is the AMD rocketship a sign that the AI infrastructure trade is over or just beginning?,"Chip companies and other AI infrastructure companies have discovered that they can generate 30-40% one-day jumps in their stock price by just announcing a deal with OpenAI to fund their build out.  First it was MSFT and NVDA, then ORCL, PSTG, AVGO and now AMD.   AMD is giving OpenAI a warrant to get a 10% piece of AMD, and today’s 30% jump in market value easily covered that giveaway to OpenAI.  Who’s next? Or is this trade done?  

I’ve got my eye on MRVL, SMCI, TSMC in the chip space, LUMN at the edge/connectivity layer, and maybe PANW with security.   I think ARM didn’t get enough juice from the announcement that they were part of the initial AI pact between ORCL-OpenAI-ARM-SoftBank, but a one-on-one deal between ARM and OpenAI would deliver a big uplift to ARM.

1nzqc64,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"No one is talking about BAND, seems like a hidden gem","**TLDR**: 56M FCF on a < 500M market cap and growth still expected.

**Business Drivers**

Bandwidth's primary business drivers include recurring usage-based revenue from its CPaaS platform, spanning voice, messaging, and emergency services via APIs. The ongoing migration of enterprise communications workloads to the cloud is a major growth catalyst. Key strategic initiatives involve expanding AI integration with platforms like Maestro and AIBridge, deepening channel and enterprise partnerships (notably with UCaaS/CCaaS providers), and broadening international reach following the Voxbone acquisition. The company's competitive advantages stem from its ownership of a nationwide IP backbone, regulatory expertise, and a partner-centric approach that embeds Bandwidth's service deep within the infrastructure of premier platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and RingCentral. This not only provides transaction-based reoccurring revenues but also fuels cross- and up-selling opportunities as enterprise customers expand their communications stack.

**Financial Performance**

Bandwidth delivered record annual revenue of $748.5 million in 2024, up 25% year-over-year, with underlying organic growth staying in the low teens after adjusting for one-off political messaging revenue. Gross margins have improved steadily (GAAP 37%, non-GAAP up to 57% in 2024), while the company edges toward net profitability (small net loss narrowing year over year). Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow have reached company highs, evidencing stronger operating leverage. For 2025, Bandwidth expects flat to moderate top-line growth due to the absence of cyclical revenue but high-single-digit growth in the core business, with further improvements in adjusted EBITDA. The stock trades at a significant discount to peers—EV/Sales and EV/Adj. EBITDA multiples remain low, suggesting considerable upside if Bandwidth delivers sustained profitability. Analysts anticipate Bandwidth will be GAAP profitable within the next year, and ongoing debt repurchases underscore management's confidence in future cash flows and balance sheet strength.

**Key Risks**

Bandwidth Inc. faces several notable risks, primarily centered around competitive pressures in the CPaaS space, heavy customer concentration, and regulatory and technological changes. The company's main competitors like Twilio are much larger and could engage in aggressive pricing tactics or broader feature rollouts that undercut Bandwidth's growth. Large customers account for a significant portion of revenue, raising the risk that the loss or reduction of a top customer could materially impact financials. Regulatory compliance is another burden, as Bandwidth operates telecom infrastructure in multiple global jurisdictions subject to frequent and complex telecommunications rules. Cybersecurity threats are ongoing, highlighted by past incidents like a DDoS attack in 2021. Additionally, macroeconomic downturns could diminish enterprise spending, putting further pressure on Bandwidth's growth despite the relative stickiness of mission-critical communication services. One-off revenue events like political campaign cycles add a layer of volatility, creating tough comparables and short-term uncertainty in financials. Debt remains an overhang, particularly regarding the convertible notes due in 2028, which will require sufficient free cash flow for repayment or favorable refinancing. Despite these risks, long-term industry trends are favorable, with the CPaaS market foreseen to grow robustly, providing Bandwidth substantial opportunity if it executes well.",Fickle-Wrongdoer-776,3,0.64,1.0,2025-10-06 19:59:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nzqc64/no_one_is_talking_about_band_seems_like_a_hidden/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nzqc64/no_one_is_talking_about_band_seems_like_a_hidden/

1nz5f5l,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Built a tool to check how exposed i am to mag 7 from different ETFs. Spoiler alert: too much exposure,"Built a FREE Tool to Analyze Stock Exposure Across ALL Vanguard  ETFs (Check your diversification!)

As an investor who is constantly trying to understand **true diversification**—especially when holding multiple ETFs—I often struggled with one question: **""How exposed am I really to a single stock (like NVIDIA, Apple, etc.) across** ***all*** **my different ETFs?""**

You buy VOO, VTI, QQQ, and maybe a sector fund, but it's really hard to know the aggregate weight of a single top holding across all of them.

So, I took matters into my own hands and built a free tool to solve this!

# Introducing: ETF Exposure Analyzer

**What it does:**

1. **Search a Stock:** Input any stock ticker (e.g., MSFT, TSLA, JPM).
2. **Analyze ETFs:** The tool instantly analyzes the holdings of **hundreds of ETFs** to identify which ones hold that specific stock.
3. **Calculate Total Exposure:** It then shows you the **weight of that stock** within each holding ETF. This is incredibly powerful for assessing your aggregate risk and unintentional concentration.

I've used it to confirm that even a ""diversified"" portfolio can have surprising concentration in the top 5-10 stocks. I hope it helps you all check your own unintentional overexposure!

# A quick note:

This is a personal project, and I'd love your feedback! Let me know what you think, any features you'd like to see added, or any bugs you find.

Currently this tool only focuses on vanguard ETFs, I am trying to get access to all the other EFTs.

nhydj6h,comment,dividends,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,28M portfolio how am I doing ?,"Its hard to tell from what you posted.  We dont know how much you started with, and can only guess a Total (year on year) return.  Its my opinion the report card ""that matters"" is your average total return (including both realized and unrealized gains, plus dividends).  Compare your average percentage of total return to the S and P 500 average, or the Nasdaq average.  Buffet says most managers ""dont beat the S and P 500"".  

It does sound like you at least have some knowledge and some diversification, among a few asset classes: Crypto, ETF's, and a few individual stocks in a couple different industries, such as heatlh care (UNH), Tech (MSFT, GOOG), and some defensive positions (WMT, JNJ).  And, you are in almost half cash.  (checking, savings, HYSA).  

You did not mention any real property, reits, metals (aka gold and silver).  

Of course, you did not mention your income, or how much you save/invest each month or year.    We cant really tell from those numbers...if You inherited $1,000,000 5 years ago, well your investments have not done all that well, for example.  But if you saved 1000 a month for the past 5 years, starting with 0, you are doing amazing.   

I was suprised to hear about a Roth, but no traditional IRA at your age.    This a little suprising, do you want to share why you have a roth and no traditional IRA?  

Im guessing you know the rule of thumb regarding whether or not to do an IRA or to do a Roth.  

With my portfolio, I write down when I buy a stock, and ""why"".  (such as ""Why did I buy WMT?"").  I also have a reasoning behind ""why I bought xxx number of shares"" of WMT, such as I felt WmT had a safety score of 8, that it merited a 10% portfolio allocation, even tho my other stocks are only 5%, because those are higher risk.  I like to keep my big money safe, and more specualtive stocks/crypto, limit to 10 percent of my portfolio, total, for example.  My crypto portfolio is way more than 10 percent now, because it started with only 5 percent, but it grew faster than my stocks, at least since 2014.  Much faster).",Silent_Speed8663,2,,,2025-10-05 22:32:26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nywm4e,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nywm4e/28m_portfolio_how_am_i_doing/nhydj6h/

1nywm4e,post,dividends,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,28M portfolio how am I doing ?,"28m have been investing for 5 years and wanted to get some feedback on my finances and portfolio. I’ve been saving, investing, and building up over the last few years.

Here’s a simplified breakdown (rounded):
	•	Cash / Checking: ~$123k
	•	High-Yield Savings: ~$28k
	•	Brokerage / Retirement (multiple accounts): ~$142k
	•	Mix of ETFs (VOO, DIA, etc.) and stocks (NVDA, WMT, GOOG, COST, MSFT, JNJ, UNH, etc.)
	•	Includes Roth IRA
	•	Crypto (staked): ~$48k (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOT, ADA)
	•	Smaller trading accounts: ~$2.5k

Total Net Worth (liquid + investments): ~ $340k

Looking for feedback:
	1.	Is my allocation reasonable for my age, or too risky?
	2.	Should I focus on maxing retirement accounts first before adding more to brokerage?
	3.	Is ~14% crypto exposure too high or fine for late 20s?
	4.	Any holes you see in this setup?

Appreciate any honest feedback!

1nyw5rp,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Do these big tech stocks hold major positions in your portfolio?,"I’ve been reviewing top investors portfolios and noticed how significant some of the big names like Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple have become across most institutional holdings. Personally, I still think companies like Google are somewhat undervalued given their fundamentals, while others with high P/E ratios make me hesitate to add more at current prices.

I’m curious how others here are positioned. Do these large-cap stocks make up a significant portion of your portfolio, or have you started rotating into smaller or undervalued sectors? What’s your current allocation strategy, and how are you thinking about balancing growth vs. value in this market?

1nysepn,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$RGTI is a scam stock,"Most retail investors have NO IDEA what they own. They see quantum in the name and buy. Even though these businesses make no revenue, no profit, and have no growth. 

For example: https://x.com/martinshkreli/status/1974488176325738784?s=46 (this post got around 1m views over the weekend exposing them) 

$RGTI The Reality Check: Revenue and Margins Collapse

On paper, Rigetti is doing what every moonshot tech company does telling us about the future. But in the present, the numbers don’t inspire much confidence.

🔹Revenue dropped 41.6% last quarter.

🔹Gross margins halved from 64% to 31%.

🔹The expiration of the National Quantum Initiative funding hurt results (though there’s a chance Congress renews it).

The CEO sold ALL of his shares at $12 a few months ago. He owns no direct shares. 

They only did 1.7M in revenue last quarter and they are trading at a 15B+ market cap. 

To its credit, Rigetti raised $350M through an ATM offering, pushing its cash pile to $572M. That’s enough runway for a couple of years, but it came at the cost of heavy shareholder dilution.

In other words: Rigetti has breathing room, but not without watering down existing investors.

This stock went up like 25% last week because they sold 2 computers for 5 million dollars. Its valuation is insane. They will almost certainly dilute stock holders so they can raise $ for their incredibly capital intensive business. 

Please be careful and don’t fall for “hype” 

There is no business, or way to success for $RGTI. 

Please buy companies with good growth, and solid fundamentals like $AMZN, $MSFT, etc and let pigs get slaughtered. 

They will tell you it’s going to keep going up but it’s just to pump their bags.

1nybong,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Betting on big boats to get a big boat,"Hello there nerds, ladies, and gentlemen, 

I want to get yacht money, so I am buying up a boat business (CCL). They've already got big boy boats. Cutting out the middlemen sales people seems like it'll save some money in the long run.

Given I need a boat that I can take the whole family on, I had to do what any reasonable person would do and put some money towards a [177,800 ton](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-princess-sets-sail-on-maiden-voyage-from-barcelona-302575263.html) cabin cruiser. 

The boring stuff:  
Repeated quarterly earnings records  
Debt is being reduced and consolidated to lower borrowing costs  
New boats (i.e. large capital expenditures) now taking paying customers  
2026 already half booked and at higher prices than 2025  
Stable EPS increases and adjusted net income trending upward at double digit rates

Q&A:  
Q: Why CCL stock?  
A: Only boats that have enough tonnage to support my mother. 

Q: Are you dumb?  
A: I can't read the question, can you ask it out loud? 

Q: Have you considered the fact it's hard to trade while at sea?  
A: Do you see how much [internet ](https://www.carnival.com/internet-plans)costs on these boats? That's called filthy profit margins. Truly disgusting.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?  
A: already long on PLTR, NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, and QCOM.

Thoughts? If this goes well I should be able to get a nice kayak to trade up from into a bigger boat.

1nxrj94,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"$NUAI - Delist threat, NASDAQ compliance, dilution and why I'm not scared","The MVLS-rule and compliance with NASDAQ can be tricky to understand—hence it's easy to act in Fear Uncertainty Doubt. Knowledge is key when it comes to deciding if it's hold or let go. At the hearing they'll most definitely request a second 180 day period to regain compliance.  
  
**At the hearing they'll say:**  
  
""-We've done this, and this, LOIs, MOUs, we're financed for recip engines, carbon capture tech, about to sign contracts. We've bought the land, done the phase 1 studies etc, we're about to build, first shovels in ground this year...  
Our market cap is above $35M, can we please get another 180 days to regain compliance? If the extra 180 days don't work we will split and finance at the end of that period.""  
  
Companies usually get a second 180 day grace period when they can show operational progress— they can do business and are about to regain compliance.   
  
A split and financing to regain MVLS would then be tabled late Q1.   
  
But that would mean they haven't signed any contracts and shit hit the fan, share price and market cap remain here or lower until Q1 next year.  
  
Looks very much like they're about to get the definitive agreements since everything is moving forward fundamentally as planned.  
  
Would be amazed if they didn't get a second grace period of 180 days for operational progress, contracts to be signed and market cap to rise organically.

Personally, I'm adding and holding while this is being manipulated by the TUTES, with darkpool shorting in the hundred millions. Whatever is shorted in, must sooner or late be bought back, things are coiling.

I've tuned out the fudsters blapping about billions of dollars in dilution long ago. When I read the prospect I knew this is some real big business about to go down.   
  
If you've got a business that'll generate 10x billions that dilution overhang you're safe to say that the devaluing effect of dilution will be offset by revenue and share price will still rise.  
  
It wont be $3 billion financing in one go, the prospect states—it's a reserve to drip feed from as the project scales, enabling management to act swiftly as opportunities arise e.g other hyperscalers wanting to grab 250MW etc. Since they're planning +1GW I doubt Microsoft will be the only behemoth moving in.   
  
I'm doing the easy part here—I buy shares in a company I believe in. Steps taken by management this year does nothing but strengthen my conviction that this is a monster in the making.

When DA for 250MW is signed, this will get going for real in my opinion. Then market have revenue visibility, debt and equity financiers will show up, and I will happily have my shares diluted. In my opinion this got the potential to 10-50x within two years considering the scale of things, true monster in the making.

1nxdjz7,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Signs Are Pointing to $QBTS Quietly Building Momentum for a 2025 Breakout,"$QBTS just secured $400M through an equity raise and added a NASA partnership, which strengthens both its funding base and credibility at a time when quantum computing is shifting from theory into real-world application. Insider activity between September 12 and 15 showed seven transactions totaling about $1.52M, with 79% of that value from sales. While that kind of selling can bring short-term pressure, it is often part of normal liquidity behavior for a company scaling at this stage. Against giants like $MSFT and $IBM, $QBTS is differentiating itself by pushing harder on commercialization. With the capital raise complete and adoption trends picking up, 2025 may be the year it proves whether it can hold ground in the broader quantum race.

Commercial traction is becoming clearer too, with bookings in Asia Pacific up 83%. Analysts are pointing to the stronger balance sheet and expanding customer adoption as reasons the outlook looks favorable. I actually made an entry on bitget to test the momentum but decided to exit for now and take more time to study the fundamentals before leaning in further.

Curious to hear how others on this sub are reading the company’s moves. Does the raise, NASA tie-in, and growth in bookings look like the right setup for long-term strength, or do you think the insider selling signals caution? Always interested in how the community here weighs in on these kinds of plays.

nhhzprq,comment,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,GOOGL or MSFT?,"I love Google's portfolio. YouTube is the most valuable entertainment asset in the world. Cloud computing is one of the best businesses in history. Near infinite scalability, high margin, high barriers to entry, and GCP is one of the big three.

With that said, I just don't know how to handicap what's going on with AI. Right now, the narrative is bullish. But the intricate details of how Search makes money is extremely complex and I just can't forecast it. I know Gemini is having it's moment, but I work with a bunch of Gen Zs and they all have ChatGPT running all day. I've never seen any of them use Gemini. Just anecdotal, but ChatGPT feels like the iPhone while Gemini feels like an Android.

GCP + YouTube is something like \~$1T in value combined. You still have $2T of value that needs to come from Search + Gemini and that's just to get to fair value for the shares. Even if you say Waymo is worth half of Uber, that doesn't really do anything. You still need $1.9T to come from Search + Gemini.

ChatGPT is worth $500B as of its last round. Let's say Gemini is worth the same, that means Search is worth $1.4T? Maybe, but I definitely wouldn't buy Search for $1.4T if it was a standalone stock.

I wish Google was split up, and I could buy shares of YouTube and GCP. I'd pay 40x earnings for each. But as a whole company, I'm not super bullish on the current valuation.

1nwondf,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Most Value Investors Under perform in the long run.,"Hey All,

I want to make it clear from the beginning, I am no one to criticize anyone else. I just want to express my humble opinion on value investing. Please take this in the best manner, i have no intention to come off as rude, arrogant or overall just a real annoying critique.

I think most people read graham or maybe the new value investors don't because of shortened attention spans. Look what worked for graham was only true because the markets were wholly inefficient and he just applied common sense, buffets early partnerships made some changes and showed signs of the shift to quality but mainly went of graham principles. Munger changes that of course, and today i believe that is really the right way to go. Most value investors statistically underperform; they just get caught up in the whole cheap thing, which is just outdated, and is a lot harder to make greater returns on. Spin offs special situations such things are not really my cup of tea, my thoughts on quant in value investing is that if dcf and the rest of qaunt analysis were so great, anyone with a computer and some algorithms would be making great returns. the former is of course not true.

What is true is finding high quality businesses with competitive advantages and barriers of entry that can be bought at a reasonable fair price. For this one must accumulate insanse amounts of knowledge to be ready when such a opportunity arises, they must research like Li Lu's famous timberland story, and 99% won't. I think that there is oppurtunity, just not for those looking for net - nets for the most part, its just a lot more difficult and the odds are not in your favour. The talks on microsoft and other big names are fine, but 20x earnings is not reasonable, and beyond tech stocks what are the real competitive advantages of LULU for example since thats trendy, i never see that. Maybe i am biased to Munger, but the numbers back him, the logic and common sense as well. 

Just my thoughts. 

Also if one had a decent understanding of healthcare, they could have capitalized on UNH is crazy fall for absolutley no good reason, from short term earning dissapointemnts to a doj case that will take years, and the ceo stepping down, and a new appointed one that worked as a executuve previously?

1nwhavv,post,options,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Anyone else watching the AI power bottleneck? ($BE, hyperscalers, and options setups)","Been digging into the whole AI infrastructure trade and realized something: everyone talks chips ($NVDA, $AMD) or software ($MSFT, $GOOGL), but the **grid might be the real bottleneck.**

Data centers are sucking up power at a pace the utilities can’t keep up with. That’s why weird names like **$BE (Bloom Energy)** are ripping — they can deploy mobile/clean on-site power fast, which hyperscalers might need if the grid lags.

The bull case is obvious: AI capex is basically bottomless right now. But the bear case is interesting too — what if demand for power simply can’t be met? That could stall capex cycles, delay purchases, and hit the whole ecosystem.

From a trading perspective:

* Volatility in these names cuts both ways
* Options can capture those violent moves (up or down)
* Momentum signals on short-term EMAs / MACD seem to work surprisingly well on these plays

Not advice, just sharing how I’m thinking about it. Curious if anyone else is setting up trades on the “AI power gap”?

I came across this video that lays out the $BE angle and some option strategy ideas pretty clearly if you’re interested: [https://youtu.be/PZhKB9dYQ0c?si=pW307XzTb1YTy3XW](https://youtu.be/PZhKB9dYQ0c?si=pW307XzTb1YTy3XW)

nhcy8wd,comment,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"Yep...totally agree with your post and I've been saying this for a while.  Amazon's crazy undervalued because their crazy depreciation (57 billion TTM!!!!) covers up their true earnings.  

While you use P/OCF it should be noted many mainstream investors use a similar metric to come to similar conclusions...and that is EV/EBITDA.

* TSLA: 126x
* NVDIA: 43.5x
* AAPLE: 26.6x
* MSFT: 24.3x
* GOOG: 19.4x
* AMZN: 19.3x
* Meta: 20.8x

You see relatively speaking these are similar to P/OCF.  I like P/OCF better because EV/EBITDA doesn't provide a premium for stock capital over debt capitol and regional taxes matter and vary a lot by company.

For evaluating growth stocks...most use EV/EBITDA but they get burned in situations where there is a lot of maintenance capex, high taxes, and/or low debt.

My preferred method is actually a modified version of non-gaap earnings.  The great thing about non-gaap income is it doesn't punish a company for receiving credit vs cash for payments (like OCF/FCF). It already deducts amortization (but not depreciation)...and often there are well documented forward yearly projections you can use.  And these non-gaap projection should take into consideration dilution, which other metric don't.  What I do is to find the non-gaap projections and simply add in the deprecation per share.  That's the real earnings per share.  If I trust I can do it for am industry (Amazon yes...mining/airline companies no...the later are depreciation capex heavy).

It should be noted that many of Amazon's assets will simply not degrade into dust.  They use funky leases for their warehouses which exaggerate their depreciation and servers use crazy aggressive schedules...even though in most cases they can be maintained in perpetuity with only minor component swaps.

Some specific numbers...Amazon depreciates servers at a 3-5 year clip (way too fast) compare to Microsoft's 5-7 year schedule.  Fulfillment robots are depreciated at a blistering 5-7 years, while Walmart uses 7-10 years.  Warehouse ROU asset leases use a 5-10 year depreciation which is bonkers.

A lot of depreciation is very subjective. eg Europe regulators don't allow maritime shippers to depreciate an entire ship...just parts like an engine.  And American's regulators allow the depreciation of real estate despite is APPRECIATING over time.   Deprecation inconsistencies are a huge problem.

The only counter argument is that most of Amazon's depreciation is for maintenance capex and not growth capex...but that's wrong.  Most of their capex is growth...per Grok their capex ratio is likely 80% growth, not maintenance.

Investors like Warren Buffet hate EV/EBITDA and P/OCF and he thinks depreciation is a super important expense.  But to be fair, EV/EBITDA investors effortlessly sported Mag7 buys years ago and jumped on them early while Warren consistently missed them and to this day is puzzled why he wasn't able to correctly valuated them.

IMO Amazon is a screaming buy and I'm very bullish.",IDreamtIwokeUp,4,,,2025-10-02 15:14:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nvuluv/amzn_is_cheaper_than_you_think/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nvuluv/amzn_is_cheaper_than_you_think/nhcy8wd/

* Polymarket traders put 42% odds on the current federal shutdown lasting 10–29 days  If it runs longer, it would be the 2nd longest ever (record was 34 days in 2018)
* Labor dept confirmed today's jobless claims data won't be released
* EU  TO PROPOSE DOUBLING TARIFF RATE ON STEEL IMPORTS TO 50%
* Taiwan has flatly rejected a U.S. proposal to shift to a “50-50” split in chip production, saying the idea wasn’t even on the table during trade talks in Washington. 
* Japan’s  10Y bonds slipped after another weak auction, with the bid-to-cover ratio dropping to 3.34 from 3.92 last month and the auction tail widening to the largest since March. Yields touched 1.65%, near 2008 highs, as markets price a 58% chance of a BOJ rate hike this month.

  
MAG7:

* AAPL - Morgan Stanley raises AAPL PT to 298 from 240. Keeps at overweight, hile the supply chain has yet to officially adjust iPhone builds, we're raising our FY26 iPhone revenue by 4% — 3% higher units and 1% higher ASPs — as our checks suggest a build increase is imminent, driven by demand strength from the iPhone 17 base, Pro and Pro Max models. Tactically, we think the market has already priced this in over the last 3 weeks, and we'd need to see upside vs. our new estimates to argue for more sustained near-term stock outperformance. 
* META - Oppenheimer on META threat to AAPL: 'it's too early to view Ray-Ban Display as an everyday wearable such as Apple Watch, let alone a potential challenger to smartphones. We came away from the demo more confident that Apple's hardware ecosystem is safe from new AI-enabled smart glasses for the next 2-3 years. It also gives Apple more runway to fine-tune its own smart glasses products.
* MediaTek’s ASIC plans are seeing delays. Reports say META's new chip orders remain uncertain due to a technical issue, while GOOGL's order isn’t finalized yet and won’t officially tape out until at least October. Mass production now looks unlikely before the second half of 2026.
* GOOGL: Jefferies raises PT to 285 from 230: While Gemini is not the obvious AI chatbot winner today, we believe it is strongly positioned to become one of the leading AI 'answer engines.' With a single chat interface that is unified and has clear intent, merging AI overviews, AI mode, and search, with intelligent self-routing applied, Google would own a high-value funnel that brings a customer from discovery all the way to making the purchase decision. Additionally, Circle to Search and Google Lens further expand the search experience with multi-modality across browsers such as Chrome and Safari. In short, Google can turn search into the ultimate decision engine.""
* AAPL -  is shelving its planned Vision Pro revamp to shift resources into AI-powered smart glasses, Bloomberg reports. 
* AAPL - UBS reiterates neutral rating, PT 220. UBS Evidence Lab data that tracks iPhone availability across 30 geographies suggests that peak demand is behind the 17 Base model, while wait times for the 'Air' across all major geographies suggest somewhat muted demand for the thinner form factor with more modest technical specs. Moreover, wait time for the Pro model is starting to ease with a notable drop in China to 13 days, below the 14 days a year ago and 20 days a week ago. Therefore, based on global wait time data, we believe aggregate iPhone 17 demand is past the initial launch peak. As such, we would expect to see wait times further erode going forward absent any new incremental/aggressive promotional activity.""  

  
OTHER COMPANIES:

* NKE - Keybnanc upgrades to overweight from sector weight, sets PT at 90.  ""We are upgrading NKE to OW as we believe 1Q results highlight improving trends from 'Win Now' actions. While we acknowledge some NT choppiness remains from tariffs, digital, and China, we believe that the Sport Offense, innovation pipeline, and marketplace resets will continue to better position Nike for a return to sustainable growth/margin recovery. In our view, there’s enough visibility to feel comfortable in the broader turnaround story and move to OW with a $90 PT, which implies 29.2x on our FY27 EPS estimates.

1nvuluv,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.

Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.

This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.

Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.

So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:

* TSLA: 91.3x
* NVDA: 59.0x
* AAPL: 34.9x
* MSFT: 28.3x
* GOOGL: 22.1x
* AMZN: 19.4x
* META: 17.6x

Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

Here’s how I see it:

* Short term: it’s going to push costs higher. $14B isn’t pocket change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this weighs on margins in upcoming quarters.
* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

Personally, I like seeing this move. It reminds me of when Amazon poured billions into AWS back in the day. Painful upfront, but it turned into one of their biggest growth engines.

What do you all think? Smart long-term play or reckless spending?

1nuzqe0,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",0bserverZ,4,0.67,0.0,2025-10-01 07:18:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/

We're looking at just 5.1% growth for the S&P 500 compared to over 12% in the previous two quarters. What's interesting though is how Adobe is trading at its lowest valuation multiple in over a decade despite maintaining decent growth projections of 12% earnings and nearly 10% revenue growth for the next two years. The market is basically pricing in that they'll lose their competitive moat to AI disruption.

This reminds me of when everyone was bearish on Microsoft in the early 2010s thinking mobile would kill them. Sometimes the market overreacts to disruption fears. Oracle is up 70% this year while Adobe is down a third, yet both are software companies facing similar AI headwinds. The question is whether Adobe at these levels represents a genuine value trap or if the market is being too pessimistic. With tech still expected to drive 12% earnings growth in Q3 while the rest of the market barely grows at 2%, it feels like there might be some babies being thrown out with the bathwater here.",Tall-Peak2618,1,0.6,8.0,2025-09-30 15:56:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nudwbs/q3_earnings_looking_weak_but_is_this_creating/,https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nudwbs/q3_earnings_looking_weak_but_is_this_creating/

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

1ntwo3a,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

1ntu5to,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"My portfolio / €1000,- each month (no advice, just your opinion)","Hi everybody,

Today I turned 22, and I thought, why not share what I’m doing when trying to invest. I’d love to hear any feedback and your opinion. 

So me (m22) started investing since this week and i currently deposited like €2000,- into my account down below, which i can afford. My long term goal is to build financial wealth through consistent investing. I currently earn like €3000,- net per month, and I plan to invest €1000,- of that every month into the following portfolio down below: 

My current portfolio on Trading 212 looks like this;

- Microsoft (3%) €60,-
- JPMorgan Chase & Co (5%) €125,-
- iShares Physical Gold (5%) €100,-
- Alibaba (5%) €100,-
- ASML (6%) €120,-
- Alphabet (Class A) (7%) €140,-
- Rolls-Royce (9%) €180,-
- iShares Core S&P 500 acc (30%) €600,-
- iShares Core MCSI World acc (30%) €600,-

I’d love to hear your thoughts on my portfolio. Do you think the allocation is reasonable? Should I consider changing anything for better long term growth or risk management? I’m new to this and would admire any insights.

The other question I have is: do you have any suggestions for a young investor trying to maximize growth while staying diversified? For reference: I still live with my parents

Thanks!!!

1ntlfop,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",Goatofoptions,0,0.41,9.0,2025-09-29 17:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/

Dark pool data shows a fat cluster of volume sitting around $283–285, so you’re parked right at the battleground.

Breakeven at $308 isn’t crazy, it’s just a question of timing. You’ve got  about 80 days, which is enough for a move, but if $280 breaks clean you’re in trouble because of the negative gamma pocket under there,could flush into $275 real quick.

Le géant de la technologie a bloqué l'accès après que nous ayons révélé que l'armée israélienne avait utilisé ses serveurs pour stocker des millions d'appels téléphoniques interceptés de Palestiniens.

Selon le Guardian, l'unité 8200 a rapidement transféré la masse de données de surveillance des serveurs de Microsoft à l'étranger quelques jours après la publication de notre enquête ; selon leurs sources, l'unité prévoyait de transférer les données vers la plateforme cloud Amazon Web Services, dont l'armée dépend de plus en plus depuis le 7 octobre.

Pourtant, de nombreux autres projets militaires israéliens impliquant les services Microsoft restent intacts. En janvier, une enquête menée par +972, Local Call et le Guardian, basée sur des documents divulgués par le ministère israélien de la Défense et la filiale israélienne de Microsoft, a révélé que le géant technologique « est présent dans toutes les principales infrastructures militaires d'Israël », des dizaines d'unités de l'armée israélienne – notamment dans les forces aériennes, terrestres et navales – s'appuyant sur les services cloud de Microsoft.

 De plus, pendant la période la plus intense des bombardements aériens israéliens sur Gaza, les ventes de services d'IA de Microsoft au ministère israélien de la Défense ont considérablement augmenté.

I’m interested to see your opinion which one of these two is better investment for the next 2-3 years from now?

1nse5u1,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

ng7qar7,comment,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,I’m not selling. NBIS,"$NBIS. A full-stack ai cloud datacenter and much more. Here's a dd:

The risk reward with NBIS is very strong. They have a track record at Yandex of building out 20 DCs. They know what they are doing which is why Microsoft signed the deal with them. Also NBIS is 400 engineers strong.

Two more greenfield sites will be announced by EOY & could be generating revenue by Q4 2026. NBIS could be guiding ARR of 5-10B by 2026 EOY.

Nvidia has a strategic partnership with Nebius that grants Nebius priority access to Nvidia's latest and most powerful GPUs. 

As an early adopter of NVIDIA Blackwell, Nebius worked with research group LMArena in collaboration with NVIDIA to bring LMArena’s Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L) system into production using GB200 NVL72 infrastructure.

Nebius's supercomputer, ISEG, ranked 16th on the Top 500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers.

Other companies under the group:

* **Avride:** A company that develops autonomous cars and delivery robots for sectors like ride-hailing and logistics. Their self driving car subsidiary is launching with Uber in October. They also just expanded their food delivery robots to a second college this semester.
* **TripleTen:** An edtech platform that offers training and reskilling for tech careers in the U.S. and Latin America.
* **Toloka AI:** A company that partners with businesses to provide data for developing generative AI.
* **ClickHouse:** An equity stake is held in this open-source column-oriented database management system. This doesn’t factor in a potential IPO of Clickhouse which they own just under 30% of.

Outside of Microsoft they still guided up to 1.1B ARR by Q4 2025.

Nebius Group Price Target Raised to $206 at Northland, Named New Top Pick After Microsoft Deal.

When choosing a company, always look at the debt. Their main competitor coreweave has $9 billion debt while NBIS has net cash $693 million.

* **CoreWeave (CRWV)** — **Net debt ≈ $9.00B** (Total debt $11.05B − cash & restricted cash ≈ $2.05B)
* **Nebius (NBIS)** — **Net cash ≈ $693M** (Cash $1.679B − total debt $986.2M ⇒ net **−$693M**)

Then they figured out that LLM's exist and made Maestro. Maestro will do what Palantir's Foundry does but for business admin people who are not SAP programming experts. Maestro is software that will automate Gen X's enterprise needs. Thrilling, I know. But they have a partnership with Microsoft, they beat earnings consistently. their YoY customer retention is great, and they say 'agentic ai' a lot. So calls obviously.

If you want more thorough DD, check out NYCandrun's post earlier this month. Revenue from Maestro most likely won't show up on their Q3 earnings, but in case it does I have January 2026 calls and January 2027 leaps.

1nprxr3,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

The moment 185 breaks is the moment I could see this hitting 210.

Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",r2002,260,0.83,114.0,2025-09-24 23:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/

Despite consensus RPA probably isnt completely replaced by AI or ML but integrated into it as time goes ln (which is why microsoft would want to acquire uiPath). Companies in RPA that will survive can integrate their tech into AI - otherwise AI will replace. AI isnt quite as good of a choice for very repetitive jobs.  

One thing you dont mention though is the actual sector’s growth - uiPath could obtain a larger slice of RPA investment/revenue but that revenue is not ticking up year over year. If anything, I would label this as a value stock - not a growth stock. AI and ML companies are growth stocks.

Everyone’s throwing billions at data centers — NVIDIA, Microsoft, hyperscalers, sovereign wealth funds. Demand for AI compute + power is exploding. But here’s the kicker:
	•	NUAI (New Era Energy & Digital) just completed Phase 1 engineering on their Texas data center campus.
	•	They control hundreds of acres in the Permian Basin — prime real estate already tied into energy + fiber corridors.
	•	They aren’t just leasing shells. They’re integrating land + energy + power islands (gas generation with carbon capture) → total control of costs & uptime.
	•	Designed for 1 GW capacity. That’s hyperscale, not boutique.
	•	And their market cap? Tiny. You’re looking at a microcap that’s valued like an old helium junior… while pivoting into the hottest infrastructure sector on the planet.

💡 Imagine what happens if even ONE anchor tenant signs on. The rerate could be violent. This is asymmetric upside: big boys chase billion-dollar campuses, NUAI is sneaking in early with land, power, and approvals already in hand.

While everyone’s chasing the same large-cap names, NUAI is sitting on the land, energy, and timing to capture this AI data center wave from the ground up.

Not financial advice, but if you’re hunting undiscovered AI infra plays, keep NUAI on your radar.

1npi0tu,post,Daytrading,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,The Psychology of Backtesting: Why Traders Struggle and How to Push Through,"Rigorous backtesting changes lives. Most strategies won't survive a high-quality backtest without lookahead bias.  Multiple people have thanked us for our posts as it them backtest properly, exposing their system's lack of profitability or negative performance.

We've also had conversations with several traders who are deep into backtesting who have complained about feeling burnt-out, fatigued, low energy, and an inability to push through their work. They are quick to rush into comfort and complacency, thinking their 30-sample size back test is somehow enough. In around 5 minutes of reading time, we won't only reveal what backtesting burnout is, but we'll also discuss how to overcome it.

**Trader Disillusionment**

**The experience these traders are having is disillusionment. Backtesting forces one to confront reality;** a trader's emotional investment in their system’s success causes them to feel synthetic fatigue when they encounter data that fails to validate their prior beliefs of the strategy’s profitability.

In essence, when you find out that the system which you worked hard to build is not  
Working on the backtest, you will feel upset, and feelings of time being wasted creep in.  
It makes you wonder if it is worth continuing to build strategies and test. It also makes you likely to just ignore backtesting entirely and trade live with this unproven strategy. But these feelings are only detrimental to your success.

It is just not possible to achieve profitability instantly; it indeed takes a few tries even armed with the knowledge of how to design systems correctly. Your mind is ”pretending"" to be tired to avoid the rigorous work required to validate a strategy.

**Being Persistent**

**In our own work, we have found that 8 out of 10 systems are not good enough to run. \[<+0.4 EV\]**  
E.V is expected value; it's the measure which tells you how much multiples of risk you average in profit per trade, including losing trades. We refer to this as ""expectancy"".

[Break-even vs an efficient trading strategy](https://preview.redd.it/hih4226db5rf1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a1d9b76c84eadb8a7dec8d11a62050d9c58c8a)

**Formula**

(Win Amount×Probability of Win)−(Loss Amount×Probability of Loss)

Ex. (2×50%)−(1×50%) 1:2 RRR 50% WR = 0.5R avg. earnings per trade placed before costs.

You can idealise a strategy in your head all day. But when you start collecting the hard evidence in a backtest, psychology takes a toll. By 'psychology' we are referring to the fact that traders will flinch; they will stall. **They will tell themselves that they can finish the back later** or that the minuscule amount of data gathered is enough and the strategy is suitable enough to be executed live on their hard-earned money **\[1\].**

**Backtesting doesn't have to be complex; it can start off simple. (even notes +3-1+3-1)**  
If you're struggling to get into it, start off small.

[Simple data collection](https://preview.redd.it/al75yjheb5rf1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=2707ec17b5971afe51fd7f0ba37c284789372dcd)

This is how simple our base data backtests look before we recount to process strategy data in spreadsheets (this saves us time).

[Example of real trading data in a spreadsheet](https://preview.redd.it/qgnpnp3jb5rf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65cc7397e336e32f5297befd6b62798c0cb7c5d)

**Natural Psychological Barriers**

**It is not the work that is hard; it is what the results might say \[2\].**

The core issue arises from a trader subconsciously recognising that their dataset (back test data) is too small or the results are inconclusive or bad, leading to a drop in discipline.

Of course, it is tempting to avoid that fear, but the true test of a strategy happens once  
this period of discomfort is ignored. Honest, thorough backtesting can give insight into  
whether a system is possibly going to lose you money or make you money. You just do not know which is the outcome until the test is complete. So, push through and get it done.

**Warning(s) about automated backtesting**

* Automated testing feels easy, but automated backtesting tools can contain inaccuracies or fail to include realistic costs. We suggest testing manually first, then if you insist then automate your system (We trade manually)
* Automated tools make parameters easy to tweak, which often leads to overfitted systems that don't work on forward tests or live trading

Overfitting is when a strategy is adjusted to work well on historical data instead of logic, which creates fantastic backtest results. But it doesn't work live because the trading behaviour was adjusted to complement what has happened historically, which includes a lot of noise and not genuine repeated market behaviours, which never repeat 1:1.

Your data should be fit closely enough for there to be an edge but not so spot-on that it memorises the market and its noise. Do not overoptimise your ideas; if it doesn't work well, it's better to move on than try to adjust and ""make it work"".

This is a really important point; stop and think when a backtest shows you what you don't want to see.

**Comfort is tempting, but precision matters:**

* Include your trading costs properly and resist idealisation.
* You must backtest and aim for at least 100 trades instead of dozens.
* Include out-of-sample data. Sure, your day trading system was great in 2024 and 2025, but what about Q1 2022 and the 2020 crash?
* Focus on peak-to-trough drawdown more than consecutive losses in a row. In risk units (R)
* Backtesting isn't performative; it's a necessary step for most in forming systematic edge(s) responsibly.
* If the idea is unique you must also forward-test it before any commitments.

**You must resist the urge to take the easy path; remember this is not a joke; your money is on the line. Rigour pays.**

# Conclusion / TLDR

Burnout happens due to disillusionment regarding your backtest. Recognise that for two well-trained traders, the difference between the one who finds a working strategy and one who does not is the backtest. Persist through the uncomfortable, boring, long periods, as this is the only way to ultimately develop a strategy that is likely to withstand the intensity of the live markets. One thing to note is that similar feelings may occur when designing a strategy too, but that is a whole other story.

For your sake, do not let backtest-induced avoidance and tiredness keep you from working hard. We have tested countless systems, and it is hard to continue, but we kept going. Nowadays, it is far easier because of experience, but if you are not used to backtesting thoroughly, then it is hard to get used to it.  
However, we promise you that you will. We did.

**You Must Keep On Going.**

1npdpk7,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,CRWV and CORZ,"All previous crypto mining stocks transitioning to AI/HPC are going up. Why? Because big tech is throwing money at them. MSFT, META, GOOG CEO’s have all acknowledged that the biggest restriction to AI growth is power not GPUs. Which companies have the most amount of power to power data centers? CRWV and CORZ. The demand is so far beyond what people currently understand. 

MSFT threw a $19B deal at NBIS for 300MW + 400MW extension. CRWV has 470MW active as of Q2 2025, and target ~1000MW by year end. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner. NVIDIA also announced that they are backstopping any excess cloud from CRWV for up to $6B up to 2030. Even if they need it or not, they agreed to this. CRWV has 2.2GW of contracted power capacity that they can expand into (the bottleneck). 

CORZ has $5B market cap. They have 900MW of power that is active and dedicated to AI but needs connecting to GPUs etc. another 400MW used for Bitcoin mining, bringing total to 1.3GW. They also have 1GW of expansion also possible. They had 50MW active and powering GPUs by Q2 2025. Year end goal is 250MW. That is 5x the revenue they were generating before. They also still have 650MW more to expand to. Remember NBIS got a $19B deal for 300MW + 400MW possible expansion. I value CORZ at $15B market cap, would not even think about selling before. I expect them to crush next earnings call and market to price them closer to fair value. For the acquisition by CRWV deal, this will not go through unless CRWV stock goes up a lot higher maybe $200. Shareholders are not happy with current deal (Two Seas capital which is largest active shareholder has shown opposition). Stock price also tanked ~30% after deal announcement, but this will also not go through unless shareholders approve (big opposition over current deal). 

Finally, just want to mention big hedge fund buying. Jane Street and Coatue Management are hedge funds that have outperformed the market significantly over last 3 years (achieving 90%+ and 180%+ over last 3 years) have made CRWV their biggest holding at 4% and 8% respectively. There is also a cracked OpenAI guy (1st in his class in Columbia) that started his own hedge fund called Situational Awareness who has like 65% returns over last two quarters has CORZ as his third biggest holding at 20% of his portfolio.

1npbyeg,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

1. you will soon realize that this a technology that is easily 10-15 years away from its first real world use cases that is according to the leading scientific experts in the field https://introtoquantum.org/essentials/timelines/#:~:text=The%20earliest%20commercial%20quantum%20applications,within%20reach%20around%202035%E2%80%932040.
2. you will soon come to the conclusion that by far the most advanced players in the industry are google and IBM not these random start-ups
3. NBIS is owned by Russian oligarchs or something like that so there is a significant geopolitical risk plus they are not even a real quantum company nothing in their about me page mentions quantum at all and the little products they have quantum related are not actually quantum just using standard GPUs for quantum chemistry research according to their website 
3. IONQ is a quantum company however they are behind Google and IBM and other major players in the number qubits so probably not the best investment option between a established companies with multiple other businesses and decades of research and infrastructure experience like IBM vs this start up that is exclusively doing this with not nearly as much capital and resources as IBM or google
4. IBM, Google, Microsoft, Intel and plenty of other well established companies have very advanced research (most of the time industry leading) and infrastructure in quantum 

TLDR: you are way better off getting your exposure to quantum through companies like IBM or Google then through a pure quantum play especially considering how even in the best case scenario according to Ioniq they are minimum 5 years away from having enough qubits to have real world use cases and are burning~100-300 mil per year with about ~300 mil in cash reserves so yea",fine_lit,7,,,2025-09-24 01:59:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nowy8m/ionq_and_nbis_sounds_like_the_top_dog_quantum/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nowy8m/ionq_and_nbis_sounds_like_the_top_dog_quantum/nfv1c12/

Everyone knows Nvidia invested in Open AI with 100 billions dollars. So, Open AI will get 100 billions dollars to buy Nvidia chipset for their data centers.  

If you got some knowledge about stockmarket history, this investment is typical what Cisco did with some client like ICG Communications.  
  
In the fact, Open AI is losing money and are not expecting to get money before 2028. So, Nvidia make an investment of 100 billion to allow them to buy the chipset. Yes, Nvidia makes a ""loan"" to his client because they don't have money. Cisco did the same

In AI business, lot of people make a big investment in data center because they've got money like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon ... but Open AI doesn't have the money. 

And what happen to ""cisco capital"" ? lot of companies declared bankrupcy during the .com crisis because the expected yield had never come. And Cisco will never get back the money.

1noibvq,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Transitioning our ROTH's from a managed brokerage (Ameriprise) to Fidelity...,"Hello all,

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

1noemka,post,Daytrading,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,All the market moving news from premarket summarised in one short 5 minute read. 23/09,"MAG7:

* EU targets AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT over online financial scams.
* NVDA: Evercore says in it's call with NVDA's CFO after the OpenAI deal reinforced that Nvidia is still the “AI ecosystem play of choice” and that Street numbers are too low. The 10GW build could add \~$5.5B in 2H26 revenue, with TAM historically $30–40B per GW and likely higher going forward.
* NVDA - said its $100B AI infrastructure deal with OpenAI won’t impact supply to others, stressing “every customer is a top priority.”
* NVDA - Barclays says that NVDA isn’t getting enough credit. Analyst Tom O’Malley (OW, $200 PT) notes OpenAI’s 10GW NVDA partnership could translate to $350B+ in revenue through the decade—roughly 3.5x the size of OpenAI’s custom ASIC program next year—arguing general-purpose silicon will power most OpenAI workloads.
* NVDA - Huawei has laid out a 3y plan to challenge NVDA in AI chips. The company says its Ascend line will scale through “SuperPod” clusters linking up to 15,488 chips, claiming interconnect speeds up to 62x faster than Nvidia’s NVLink144.

OTHER COMPANIES:

* xAI: Elon Musk says that just like xAI was the first to build 1 gigawatt of unified training compute, they’ll also be the first to hit 10 gigawatts, 100 gigawatts, and eventually 1 terawatt.
* JNJ - Guggenheim upgrades JNJ to Buy from neutral, raises PT to 206 from 167. Given the comfort we have in how the company has navigated the loss of exclusivity for their $10 billion-plus asset, Stelara, and the emerging new product story in their Innovative Medicine business that we expect to drive the company's next era of growth. This includes products that have already been on the market for many years but where we see meaningfully more upside (e.g., Tremfya, Darzalex, Spravato, Caplyta), as well as newer assets that we believe the Street is not yet properly appreciating (e.g., Inlexzo \[TAR-200\], TAR-210, Rybrevant, icotrokirra, JNJ-48
* BA - may be close to sealing a deal with China for up to 500 jets. U.S. lawmakers raised the topic during meetings in Beijing, and Ambassador David Purdue said negotiations are in their “last days or weeks,” which would mark Boeing’s first big China sale in years.
* WRD & GRAB: are teaming up to launch Ai.R, Singapore’s first autonomous shuttle service in residential areas. Backed by the LTA, the pilot will start in Punggol with 11 robotaxis using WeRide’s Robotaxi GXR and Robobus, both already certified for local service. Ai.R rides will be available in the Grab app.
* ASMI - cut its 2H revenue outlook, now expecting 2025 growth at the low end of its 10%–20% range. The chip-equipment maker cited weaker demand and softer bookings as Intel and Samsung lose ground in AI chips, with Intel cutting jobs and Samsung posting its first profit drop since 2023.
* LRCX - Keybanc downgrades to sector weight from overweight, we do not believe a corresponding increase in consensus expectations or actual earnings power is imminent—a setup the companies themselves acknowledged in the second-quarter earnings season. Given the increase has been driven more by multiple expansion than incremental earnings growth, we see share price sustainability as at risk.
* DIS - SAYS JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE SHOW TO RETURN ON TUESDAY
* SNDK - BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan raised the firm's price target on SanDisk to $125 from $59 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares.
* CRWV - Wells Fargo upgraded CoreWeave to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $170, up from $105.
* CRWV - Melius Research upgraded CoreWeave to Buy from Hold with a $165 price target.
* OKLO - Oklo downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Seaport Research
* MP - Materials initiated with an Outperform at Daiwa PT $80
* PLTR - BofA raised the firm's price target on Palantir to $215 from $180 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after spending time with Akshay Krishnaswamy, the company's Chief Architect.
* IREN - Roth Capital with Price target of$82
* ORCL - Oracle is seeking new AI server manufacturing partners in Taiwan to help it with $455 billion in RPOs (remaining performance obligations), including $300 B from OpenAI, $20 B from Meta, media report, noting its main suppliers are Foxconn and Mitac, but it has now added Quanta and Wiwynn

OTHER NEWS:

1no73r0,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Why NUAI is a Bigger Deal Than Most People Realize,"A lot of people saw my last post about NUAI and asked why this little company matters so much right now. Here’s the breakdown in simple terms:

1️⃣ They pivoted into the hottest sector on earth.

NUAI used to be New Era Helium. They rebranded and are now building AI + HPC data center infrastructure. With AI demand exploding, the bottleneck isn’t just GPUs anymore...it’s power and data center space. NUAI is targeting that choke point. (Think of it like this: they're providing the picks and shovels for AI instead of gold.)

2️⃣ They’re building a massive project in Texas.

Their flagship is Texas Critical Data Centers (TCDC) in Ector County, right in the Permian Basin. The scale is absolutely huge...hundreds of megawatts of dedicated power for AI computing. They’re basically partnering with energy providers to tap natural gas and sustainable sources, which hyperscalers (Amazon, Google, MSFT, etc.) are all hunting for.


3️⃣ The timing couldn’t be better.

The biggest U.S. data center hubs (Dallas–Fort Worth, Northern Virginia, Phoenix) are TAPPED OUT on land and power. NUAI is stepping up with fresh land, abundant energy, AND connectivity right when the AI arms race needs it most.

So, in summary...NUAI is trying to become the Nvidia of land + power + connectivity for AI data centers. There's a good chance they'll succeed too, because they're one of the only companies that can offer land + power + connectivity at scale. This company is a MUCH bigger deal than you imagine.

nfota4u,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Where does the massive Nvidia-OpenAI deal leave Microsoft?,"Doesn’t really impact Microsoft. Microsoft is so overwhelmed with demand they’re leasing capacity from neoclouds.

The way I see it: Nvidia is trying to prolong the capex cycle and bid up the hyperscalers. They have more money than they can spend so might as well support the hyperscaler that doesn’t care about making a profit right now and is committed to spending as much as possible to achieve ASI. Now, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, xAI, etc are going to feel the heat and look to spend even more to remain competitive. Of course most of the spend will go to Nvidia.

Broadcom sold off on the news but Open AI has already committed to them. It’s normal for hyperscalers use both custom and merchant silicon (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, ByteDance already do it). 

Another benefit for Nvidia is they get to benefit from the upside in their new equity in Open AI. So you’re getting more GPU orders, bidding up your customers, and get equity upside.

It’s hard to keep up with tech given the major news every day but despite all the crazy spending, I think we have enough evidence the AI capex build out will continue until at least the end of the decade.

1nny89w,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",Mattdezenaamisgekoze,0,0.5,20.0,2025-09-22 22:51:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/
1nnxe6i,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Intel’s Nvidia Lifeline - Desperate Wager or Stroke of Genius?,"The big news is the alliance between Intel and NVIDIA. NVIDIA is pumping $5 billion into Intel, sending the stock soaring while AMD's took a hit. For Intel, it's a desperately needed lifeline into the AI data centre space. For NVIDIA, it's a strategic hedge against relying solely on Taiwan's TSMC and a way to win political points with Washington. AMD is now caught in the crossfire, facing a new competitor attacking it on both the CPU and GPU fronts.

But this deal doesn't fix Intel's core problem: its grand plan to become a contract chip maker (a ""foundry"") is in deep trouble. The company's own SEC filings bluntly admit they have been ""unsuccessful to date in attracting significant customers"".

So, everything now hinges on one massive bet: their next-generation 18A manufacturing process. This tech is genuinely revolutionary, with new ""RibbonFET"" transistors and ""PowerVia"" backside power delivery that could, in theory, leapfrog TSMC's upcoming N2 node. Microsoft has given them a huge vote of confidence by signing on to use 18A, but the stakes couldn't be higher.

The bear case is terrifying: persistent rumours of alarmingly low manufacturing yields (some as low as 10%) could kill the entire strategy before it begins. Meanwhile, Intel is still bleeding market share to AMD in its core CPU business and is a distant third in the AI chip race, where NVIDIA's software moat is almost impossible to overcome.

My take? Investing in Intel today is a venture capital-style bet on a single, binary outcome. If they can execute flawlessly and get 18A working at scale by 2025, the stock is extraordinarily cheap. If they stumble, the decline could be terminal. It's a high-risk, high-reward play for the brave.

1nnvw71,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Thoughts on JCI,"Looking at where hyperscaler contracts might land (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google). Has anyone thought about JCI (Johnson Controls)?

Cooling is a big deal.

Data centres are running hotter than ever because of AI and higher density racks. NVIDIA just reported a partnership with OpenAI to build 10 gigawatts of AI data centres using NVIDIA chips. That’s a lot of energy and a lot of heat generated.

Old school air cooling ain’t cutting it. I see that JCI’s offering Silent Aire coolant distribution units that scale from half a megawatt to 10mw+. That’s tailor made for hyperscalers building AI farms. They’ve announced a long term partnership with Tabreed (a giant district cooling company in the Middle East) to push for next gen cooling. 

JCI’s reach is bigger than people realize too.

NA: their biggest unit is lead by Julie Brandt, who just got a special RSU retention package because the board doesn’t want her going anywhere. Instead she’ll be leading the biggest growth market until 2027.

EU: strong in chilled water, smart building retrofits, and compliance heavy ESG projects. Hyperscalers love this because EU regulators are strict on efficiency.

APAC: Silent Aire has hubs in China, Singapore, India, and Australia. They’re selling chillers for crazy hot climates. Again, perfect for AI data centers.

Bottom line.

JCI might not be as flashy as NVIDIA or AMD but someone has to keep those AI racks cool.

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further. MAG7 is becoming more and more exposed to AI, with cash flows going towards datacenter buildout and training AI models rather than innovation or shareholder returns.",skilliard7,586,0.96,168.0,2025-09-22 18:19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnqz79/nvidia_will_invest_up_to_100_billion_in_openai/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnqz79/nvidia_will_invest_up_to_100_billion_in_openai/
nfm6qdb,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"> On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective. It's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in **datacenter capex** in 2025.

- Meta - $72b
- Google - $75b
- Microsoft - $80b
- Amazon - $100b

IMO you arrived at the wrong conclusion despite the answer clearly being right there in your post.

The figures for the big 4 are CAPEX. Meaning that's what they spent to actually build new data centers. That includes real estate, construction, and all the server hardware that goes into them. They OWN these data centers.

As far as I can tell, this deal isn't Oracle building data centers which OpenAI is going to own - it's strictly for compute power which OpenAI is going to RENT from Oracle (OpEX).

Your comparison is like saying, ""*Bob spent $50k to buy a car, so it's perfectly normal for Steve to spend $40k to rent a car.*""

For comparison, Azure's annual revenue is $75B and Google Cloud's annual revenue is $58B. So OpenAI, by itself, is going to spend as much on cloud compute as ALL of Azure/GCP's customers?

Also, Oracle's annual revenue is $59B. OpenAI is going to pay more in revenue than all of Oracle's other businesses combined?

Even if we accept at face value that OpenAI has the funding secured to come through on their end of the deal. I'm assuming Oracle doesn't just have $60B worth of compute power sitting in their back pocket, so it would need to be built out within the next 2-3 years. Does Oracle even have the manpower to build out that much infrastructure (basically the size of Azure today) based on the timeline of the deal?

The proposed reasoning behind this deal is that the big 4 can't build out new capacity fast enough to fulfill demand, but somehow Oracle doesn't have this problem? Data centers have become so commoditized that it doesn't really matter anymore who builds them. Most of the existing prime locations (such as North VA) are oversaturated so everyone's scrambling to find new places to build. The biggest constraints are now water/cooling/power and because of that the bottleneck is now dealing with increased resistance to new data center construction from regulatory road blocks and hostility from the area residents.

I think this deal is more likely an *option* for OpenAI to purchase *up to* $300bn in compute power, rather than a commitment to that amount.",sccm_sometimes,1,,,2025-09-22 17:40:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/nfm6qdb/

1nnki3f,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,DD: Why I’m Bullish on $ORCL and $NVNI (Oracle + Nuvini Partnership in LATAM AI Growth),"Oracle ($ORCL) just announced its participation in the largest technology event in Latin America — TDC São Paulo (Sept 17–19). They’re putting heavy focus on AI in the enterprise space through keynotes, workshops, hands-on labs, and immersive experiences.

This matters because Latin America is an underpenetrated but rapidly growing AI and enterprise SaaS market.

Now here’s where Nuvini ($NVNI) comes into play:
	•	Nuvini is an Oracle partner → This partnership gives NVNI a direct seat at the table as Oracle expands its AI ecosystem in LATAM.
	•	SaaS consolidator model → NVNI acquires and scales B2B SaaS companies in Brazil and across Latin America. Think of them as a mini-conglomerate for niche software businesses.
	•	Oracle + NVNI synergy → Oracle gets local adoption and reach, NVNI gets to leverage Oracle’s AI + cloud infrastructure for its portfolio companies.

Why I’m bullish:
	•	$ORCL continues to prove it’s not just competing with $MSFT and $GOOG in AI/Cloud, but carving out unique regional plays.
	•	$NVNI is small-cap, but with Oracle’s backing, it could ride the AI adoption wave in Brazil and LATAM.
	•	LATAM’s SaaS and AI markets are still early-stage → huge runway for growth.

Risks:
	•	NVNI is a low-float, small-cap stock → volatility is high.
	•	LATAM markets carry macro risks (currency, politics, inflation).

My view:
$ORCL = the safe, global AI cloud giant.
$NVNI = the speculative, high-upside play tied directly to Oracle’s expansion in Latin America.

If Oracle’s push in São Paulo is successful, NVNI could be one of the quiet winners that benefits from the partnership.",BASEflyer_,40,0.98,7.0,2025-09-22 13:59:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nnki3f/dd_why_im_bullish_on_orcl_and_nvni_oracle_nuvini/,https://reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nnki3f/dd_why_im_bullish_on_orcl_and_nvni_oracle_nuvini/

1nmxi6l,post,dividends,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,dividend stocks for ISA (t@x-free),"Hello,

I have a not-so-bad growth pie of shares (AVGO, EQQQ, MSFT, LLY, VUSA,IWDA), but i also try to work out some best dividends (moderate risk apetite with nice income).

As this is in ISA, i pay no tax from dividends.

Currently, i found this gem, JEQP.L which I bought at £17.7 per share (23.85$) and it pays monthly on average 0.23$. That is quite a good ratio.
I also have XYLU.L and QYLD.L, but these pay less than jp morgan.

Are there any other high paying dividend stocks with moderate risk and volatility (no yieldmax stuff)?",akaaWins,0,0.5,3.0,2025-09-21 19:08:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nmxi6l/dividend_stocks_for_isa_txfree/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nmxi6l/dividend_stocks_for_isa_txfree/

nfbtz0t,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","Its capital intensive business indeed but that Capex will be coming from future revenues, once these start rolling in. Even the debt they incurred is at incredibly favourable rates due to conversion feature, which of course results in dilution but that is not really a huge dilution. For those saying it will not be profitable its mainly because of depreciation as company guide to ADJ EBITDA profitability this quarter. If EPS is skewed downwards bcz of depreciation its not a big deal as Dep is only an accounting cost (not economic cost impacting cash flows). Them being EBITDA profitable means Cash Flow possitive even without MSFT deal and that MSFT deals is a lifeline that funds their future Capex.

This stock is fundamentally strong, its undervalued at current prices. Watch them raise ARR guide and this will run, and with 1-2 more deals it will 2-3x from current levels.",Mediocre_Wave_7441,3,,,2025-09-21 01:07:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/nfbtz0t/
1nmcc8e,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Looking for Value Stock Ideas to Add a 10% Position to My Roth IRA Portfolio,"I’m a long-term investor (43 years old), and I’ve been building out my Roth IRA with a focus on quality companies that I believe have strong moats and growth potential. Right now, my portfolio is fully allocated at 100%, but I’m planning to add some fresh contributions soon and want to carve out a new 10% position.

Current holdings and allocations:

•  AAPL: 15%
•  AMZN: 20%
•  COST: 20%
•  MSFT: 20%
•  MSTR: 5%
•  NVDA: 10%
•  QCOM: 10%

I know this skews pretty heavy toward tech/growth (with a bit of crypto exposure via MSTR), so I’m specifically looking for value-oriented ideas to diversify a bit—think undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals, low P/E or P/B ratios, good dividends, or companies trading below intrinsic value.

nfbor6t,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","The risk reward with NBIS is very strong. They have a track record at Yandex of building out 20 DCs. They know what they are doing which is why Microsoft signed the deal with them.

Two more greenfield sites will be announced by EOY & could be generating revenue by Q4 2026. NBIS could be guiding ARR of 5-10B by 2026 EOY.

This doesn’t factor in a potential IPO of Clickhouse which they own just under 30% of. 

Their self driving car subsidiary is launching with Uber in October. They also just expanded their food delivery robots to a second college this semester. 

Outside of Microsoft they still guided up to 1.1B ARR by Q4 2025.

1nm8qt5,post,dividends,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Dividend/Growth Portfolio?,"I have a small robinhood portfolio that has roughly a 60% dividend stock/30% growth stock split. The thesis is to capture some capital appreciation through growth stocks, with the bulk of the portfolio being comprised of high quality, high dividend stocks. My goal is to build this to a point where it produces enough dividends on a monthly basis to cover a significant portion of my monthly expenses. I am currently in my mid 30s, so I anticipate this being a roughly 20+ year project.

My fund is currently split as follows (The other 8.6% is allocated to non-growth/non-high dividend stocks that I'm unloading at certain price targets over time):

**Growth Stocks (roughly 38.1%)**

* NVDA (13.26%) 
* AMZN (8.23%)
* MSFT (7.78%)

nfad9p7,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now",Yes.  Nbis is undervalued if they can make good on their contract for Microsoft and deliver without a huge stock dilution.  And it is not often one comes across a stock one can have such high conviction for.  There are always risk but nbis is a great buy.,1234golf1234,11,,,2025-09-20 20:20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/nfad9p7/
nfaat8m,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","Solid breakdown. The key question here is the nature of the Microsoft contract.

nfa370n,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","I think people are wildly overestimating the value of a data center that is leveraged on buying GPUs that quickly depreciate. There’s a reason that Microsoft doesn’t want to just build this themselves and keep in on their balance sheet. Look at Google with custom TPUs- that is also Microsoft’s future with custom silicon, and they don’t want to be stuck with a million Nvidia GPUs extremely expensive price/performance spec wise compared to their internal silicon efforts. As an industry insider this is very clear to me, but if you only passively invest and don’t understand the full story under the hood I can see why you get swept into the hype…for now.",ElectricalGene6146,18,,,2025-09-20 19:30:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/nfa370n/
nf9uff2,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","I hold a decent NBIS position and am bullish. However it’s not free money and can easily pull back. They aren’t profitable and won’t be anytime soon (eg 5 years). The neocloud business is a blood bath. You need to raise tons of money through debt and stock dilution to fund GPU purchases, data center construction and maintenance, etc. 

The money Microsoft is committing is not prepaid. Nebius has to setup the capacity first and then integrate Microsoft before they see the first cheque.

My guess is it’s going to cost Nebius around $15B to earn the $19B from Microsoft ($4B margin over 5 or so years). It’s tiny money. Of course, Nebius will be able to sell its capacity to other partners as well.

The key thing to keep in mind is Nebius will have to continue diluting shareholders and raise debt/convertible bonds to deliver their operations. 

This thing will be super volatile and can swing 10% from one day to the next but given enormous cloud demand I expect it to 3-10x within the next 5 years. Short term floor is around $70 IMO.",mayorolivia,30,,,2025-09-20 18:48:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/nf9uff2/

1nm2ecd,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can’t lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

They just 5x their yearly revenue, but the stock is only up 40% on the announcement

Edit: just to add: I think people are underestimating the experience at nebius. Nebius comes out of yandex, which was the Google of Eastern Europe. Know for being a great company to work for who looked after their employees, the ceo was very against the Ukraine invasion, fled, took the top talent with him, and know you are look at a 20b market cap company that has people with experience of scaling world leading tech, and who are looking to make a stand",Longjumping_Kale3013,299,0.86,187.0,2025-09-20 18:17:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/
1nm0a5q,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

“Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm’s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron’s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.” 【Barron’s】

Barclays – PT $175

“Barclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.” 【Barron’s】

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) – PT $175

“Deutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.” 【Investors.com】

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) – PT $182

“Mizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron’s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron’s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.” 【MarketWatch】

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) – PT $185

“UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron’s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron’s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.” 【PriceTargets.com】

Susquehanna – PT $200

“Susquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron’s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.” 【PriceTargets.com】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

Zacks Investment Research – Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75–$200)

“Zacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks’ consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron’s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.” 【Zacks / MarketBeat】

Micron Management Quotes & Context

“Micron’s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.” — Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  ￼

“Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼
	
Guidance for Q4:
“We expect revenue of $10.7 billion ± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ± $0.15 per share.” — Micron management.  ￼

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise.

1nlztft,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$NUAI Full DD and breakdown of evidence as to why I believe $MSFT is the hyperscaler on their LOI for 250-1000MW powered land.,"https://preview.redd.it/7xjb8ahwybqf1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c9c70f2c5ebe229e21ac6f213670f6b6b3bf945

New Era Energy & Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUAI), a nanocap company with a $10 million market cap, got ambitious plans for data centers and fiber networks, hinting at a major hyperscaler partnership. Evidence points to Microsoft as the likely partner, driven by NUAI’s helium and natural gas assets, strategic infrastructure deals, and ties to Microsoft’s technology ecosystem. Here’s why I believe Microsoft would be interested in a small player like NUAI, and how their plans align. I’ll also address the delist notice and why I believe NUAI will meet the requirements for NASDAQ compliance.

This is not financial advice, this post is speculative guesses based on publicly available information. Penny stocks like $NUAI without definitive agreements and revenue certainty remain highly speculative. Do your own due diligence.

# In a hurry?

1. **Context Labs Partnership**: Microsoft is the only hyperscaler with a confirmed tie to Context Labs, whose technology underpins NUAI’s sustainable data center plans.
2. **Fiber Network Alignment**: The GlobeLink-NUAI fiber route connects Microsoft Azure hub cities, and the timing of Microsoft’s hollow-core fiber announcement aligns with the 1,600-mile MOU. Microsoft also plan to lay 15000 km of Hollow Core Fiber worldwide, so far no mention on where.
3. **Natural Gas and Helium Needs**: NUAI’s assets match Microsoft’s requirements for powering data centers and cooling quantum processors.
4. **Strategic Use of NUAI**: Microsoft likely leverages NUAI’s regional assets and permits to fast-track infrastructure projects.
5. **Delist threat:** NUAI received a Nasdaq notice on September 3, 2025, for failing to maintain a $50 million market value of listed securities (MVLS). The company requested a hearing, pausing delisting. A second 180-day grace period is likely, given NUAI’s operational progress

# Take the plunge!

**Exhibit A: Context Labs and Mawgan Capital’s Role in NUAI’s Build**

The joint venture NUAI/Sharon AI, Texas Critical Data Centers (TCDC), signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Mawgan Capital to deploy a natural gas–based power system for its Ector County Data Center Campus in Texas. Mawgan, fully funding the project, will use its Digital Zero Power solution, powered by Context Labs, Context AI Enterprise Carbon Management Platform. This system leverages low-carbon-intensity gas certificates and carbon credits to provide sustainable, reliable power with a reduced carbon footprint, critical for eco-conscious hyperscalers.

Context Labs has a confirmed partnership with Microsoft, integrating its decarbonization solutions with Microsoft Azure to optimize emissions tracking for data centers. As the only hyperscaler publicly tied to Context Labs, Microsoft’s Azure platform aligns perfectly with NUAI’s goal of building sustainable, high-performance data centers,

**Exhibit B: GlobeLink Fibers and Microsoft’s Hollow-Core Fiber Ambitions**

NUAI also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with GlobeLink Holdings to develop a 1,600-mile fiber optic network across Texas, part of GlobeLink’s broader 2,500-mile route. This network, designed for AI and hyperscale workloads with over 30 terabits per second capacity, will connect key cities like Odessa, San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas—many of which are Microsoft Azure core hub cities. This alignment suggests the fiber route is tailored to Microsoft’s infrastructure needs.

In September 2025, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in hollow-core fiber technology through its 2022 acquisition of Lumenisity, achieving lower latency and higher bandwidth than traditional fiber. Microsoft plans to deploy 15,000 km of hollow-core fiber worldwide but hasn’t specified locations. The 1,600-mile NUAI-GlobeLink project, starting in Odessa where NUAI’s assets are located, could be the first leg of this rollout, leveraging NUAI’s regional permits and rights-of-way to streamline deployment.

**Why NUAI for a Major Infrastructure Project?**

A nanocap like NUAI securing an MOU for a massive 1,600-mile fiber project seems improbable unless it’s acting as a regional facilitator for the hyperscaler. NUAI’s land assets in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, including its Pecos Slope Field, provide access to natural gas and helium, plus critical permits and infrastructure rights. Microsoft could be using NUAI as a “shell” to navigate local regulations and accelerate project timelines, avoiding the complexities of direct land acquisition.

**Microsoft’s Natural Gas-Powered Data Centers**

Microsoft has been exploring natural gas to power its data centers, aligning with NUAI’s LOI with Mawgan for a behind-the-meter natural gas power system. Context Labs’ emissions control technology, integrated with Azure, ensures these data centers meet sustainability goals by tracking and mitigating carbon output. This setup is ideal for Microsoft, which is scaling its Azure data centers to meet AI and cloud computing demands while maintaining environmental commitments, Q45 reporting and net zeron operations.

**NUAI’s Growing Hyperscaler Discussions**

Since November 2024, NUAI has been in talks with high-energy users and hyperscalers, with project scopes escalating rapidly:

* **November 2024**: Plans for a 90MW data center.
* **January 2025**: Expanded to 250MW.
* **July 2025**: Scaled to 1,000MW.
* **September 2025**: Plans for 1,000MW and beyond, plus the 1,600-mile fiber network.

This growth suggests a major hyperscaler is driving demand.

**NUAI’s Helium and Natural Gas Assets**

Originally New Era Helium, NUAI pivoted to energy and digital infrastructure after failing to complete its Pecos Slope helium plant. While its helium contracts underperformed, NUAI’s 137,000 acres in Southeast New Mexico hold proved and probable helium and natural gas reserves. Hyperscalers like Microsoft need both:

* **Natural Gas**: Powers data centers efficiently, especially with Context Labs’ emissions controls.
* **Helium**: A finite resource critical for cooling Microsoft’s Majorana 1 quantum processor, which requires near-absolute-zero temperatures in dilution refrigerators. Helium is also used in semiconductors, data center cooling research, nuclear reactors, and quantum computing.

Helium demand is projected to grow significantly by 2035, driven by quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, space applications and AI infrastructure. As a finite resource, helium’s scarcity makes NUAI’s reserves increasingly valuable to a hyperscaler investing in quantum and AI technologies.

**Avoiding Nasdaq Delisting and Reverse Split**

On September 3, 2025, NUAI received a Nasdaq notice for failing to maintain a $50 million MVLS after a 180-day grace period ending September 2, 2025. NUAI requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, which pauses delisting pending the hearing’s outcome. At the hearing, NUAI will present its compliance plan, including raising capital via equity lines or private investments (PIPEs) to boost shareholder equity above $2.5 million or achieve a $35 million MVLS for the Nasdaq Capital Markets tier.

**Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) before Christmas is optimal**: During the hearing process, normally delisting is paused, allowing $NUAI to continue trading for approximately 2–3 months until a decision is made. The panel could grant a second 180-day period if $NUAI demonstrates a viable plan to boost its MVLS (e.g., through partnerships, asset sales, or equity offerings). While $NUAI has been communicating construction starts this year, what’s left is obtaining the final permits, negotiating terms in PPA and securing the hyperscaler customer with a definitive agreement before first shovel in ground.

**Operational Progress to Boost Valuation**: NUAI’s partnerships with Mawgan Capital and GlobeLink, plus its hyperscaler discussions, are driving operational momentum. The LOI with Mawgan for sustainable power and the 1,600-mile fiber MOU signal significant revenue potential, likely increasing NUAI’s market cap. These projects, tied to hyperscaler demand, could elevate valuation in the coming months, especially if Microsoft’s involvement is confirmed.

**Second Grace Period Likelihood**: Many companies receive a second grace period after a hearing if they demonstrate credible progress. Nasdaq often grants extensions for promising plans. NUAI’s strategic partnerships and hyperscaler traction make a second grace period likely, potentially extending into Q1 2026.

**Reverse Split as a Last Resort**: A reverse stock split is a tool NUAI could present to Nasdaq to show readiness to meet listing requirements by reducing shares and boosting share price. However, NUAI is unlikely to pursue this immediately, prioritizing capital raises and operational milestones. A reverse split would likely be tabled only if the potential second grace period ends without compliance, expected in Q1 2026.

Based on the trajectory $NUAI is on, the “delist-scare-period” is where I'm loading the boat. If everything materializes and project milestones keep being met, I believe we’re in for a good ride in the upcoming quarter.

Let’s say one of your holdings is doing really well, like skyrocketing. But of course, you know it can just as easily drop at the same rate. 

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA.

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

1nlr57e,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,My highly speculative case for $ARAI Arrive AI. I’d love to hear your feedback.,"Just a quick fyi, this isn’t just my case, I did get some help from AI.  That being said let’s dive in.  

Currently only trading at roughly $3.10 per share with only 3.45 million in the float and 33 million outstanding it’s worth keeping an eye on.  They also just announced a $10,000,000 share buyback through next March. That being said their financial situation is great so this is very high risk in my opinion.

1.  It’s not a mailbox company, it’s a platform company like Amazon or Microsoft and arguably Tesla.  Yes, they do have patented technology for their temperature controlled mailbox known as an arrive point to secure deliveries from human or drone, but the real value is the data.  If, (and it is a big if) they execute, virtually every package will start and/or end at an arrive point.  Their Arrive Point platform has the ability to track that.  Amazon knows what you buy from them but they dont know what you buy from wal mart.  Arrive AI has the potential to know what you buy from any and everyone.  What would Amazon pay for that data?

2.  Vast addressable market: Arrive AI projects that it could achieve billions in annual revenue by capturing just a small portion of the U.S. last-mile delivery market. If the company expands successfully on a global scale, the revenue potential would be astronomical.
Unique market position: As a ""mailbox-as-a-service"" platform, Arrive AI aims to provide the essential infrastructure for automated logistics, including deliveries via robots and drones. If it becomes the industry standard, its network could become a core utility, similar to how charging networks are vital for electric vehicle adoption.

3.  Data advantage: The company's business model is not just about the hardware (the Arrive Points) but also the AI platform that manages the logistics data. This real-time data on delivery movements could provide a valuable edge for optimizing efficiency and creating additional revenue streams.  The mailbox will be able to test for any dents or defects and automatically schedule a return with Amazon and order you a new one with their AI platform, without you having to make a trip to the ups store.

4.  Strong patent portfolio: Arrive AI has been securing patents since 2014, including for its smart mailbox technology. This protected intellectual property gives it a defensible position against competitors. 

5.  They currently have a pilot program in place in the smart city of Peachtree Corners, Georgia  and they are working with T-Mobile to utilize their 5G network.  Arrive AI will be using a subscription model to acquire their product so you don’t have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars upfront to install an Arrive Point.  What if the arrive platform was part of your T Mobile plan?  Or even better, what if this platform was included as part of your Amazon Prime Membership? So instead of having another monthly payment it’s just another perk for your prime membership and now Amazon has access to all of their data.

6.  Arrive points are hard wired in.  They have the capability to charge drones.  What if they also were designed to charge EV’s.  So if this becomes standard it would t be hard to find a charging point, and the owner of that specific arrive point could receive a kick back",Mc-SucceSS13,5,0.86,6.0,2025-09-20 08:46:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nlr57e/my_highly_speculative_case_for_arai_arrive_ai_id/,https://reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nlr57e/my_highly_speculative_case_for_arai_arrive_ai_id/

Even if OpenAI can't pay for the whole project because they get out-muscled by Google, or choked out by Microsoft, Oracle will be able to just build it with other clients, or through financing as an independently owned asset.

That could be a part of it?,Humble_Dimension9439,2,,,2025-09-19 14:00:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/nf21be0/
1nl1f0l,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",auradragon1,113,0.89,56.0,2025-09-19 13:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/

MSFT has the last 15 years, excluding 2018, been between 7 and 37 PE. Today its at 37. 

META PE history is a bit wired because it was above 30, upwards to 120 until 2016 because of low income. So for META lets do from 2016, PE ratio has been between 13 and 33. Its now at 28.

1nk0wm9,post,pennystocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,BIO-Key International - BKYI DD,"This company came up on my screener. It seemed interesting, so I did what everyone else is doing. Here is the DD.

**What they do:**  
Per Schwab: BIO-key International, Inc. develops and markets fingerprint identification biometric technology and software solutions, and enterprise-ready identity access management solutions for commercial, government, and education sectors in the United States and internationally.

**Financials:**

Q2 2025 Revenue: 1.7m

Gross Margin: 73% (Down from 77% a year ago)

Net Loss: 1.17m

Operating expenses: Decreased 8% same time last year

**Catalysts/Strengths:**

1.     Growing demand for identity security and stronger authentication. The trend in this space is growing towards multifactor authentication, which is exactly what BKYI is selling.

2.     Defense/Gov’t market focus with their CyberDefense Initiative. Government contracts are typically stickier. Good sign if they can nail down contracts.

3.     Geographic expansion. They recently started branching out internationally which widens their potential customer base.

4.     Improved operational discipline which shows on the balance sheet.

**Risks & Weaknesses:**

1.     Not Profitable. Technically Pre positive Net Income, but pre-revenue sounds cooler.

2.     Delisting Risk. If they delist, that could mean a drop in SP.

3.     Reverse split is possible if they cannot get over $1 by Nov 5^(th).

4.     Competition with bigger players like Okta and Microsoft. Differentiation is key.

5.     Long sales cycles, especially for government contracts.

**Playing with numbers:**

I really don’t want to bore you with the math, but if they can grow revenue 10% quarter over quarter at minimum, and reduce operating costs by 5% annually going forward, BKYI could reach profitability in about 1.5 years from now.

I will likely buy a starter position tomorrow.

1njwxna,post,ValueInvesting,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,NBIS - Nebius Group N.V,"Nebius Group could be a short term high momentum opportunity. The primary catalyst is the recent, transformative ~$18 billion deal with Microsoft, which fundamentally validates the company's AI infrastructure model and underpins its explosive revenue growth. The news resulted in a massive price and volume surge, strong institutional buying (with several major funds initiating or increasing positions), and positive analyst upgrades with new, higher price targets. Technically, the stock is in a powerful uptrend, trading well above its moving averages, though short-term indicators like the RSI (70.97) are in overbought territory, suggesting potential for consolidation. However, the overwhelming positive news flow, strong call option interest around the $100 strike, and a successful subsequent capital raise indicate that the market has absorbed the recent gains and is positioning for further upside. While the company is not yet profitable, investors are clearly focused on the massive growth potential solidified by the Microsoft partnership.

1njurb9,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

1njhtof,post,france,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,IA et Emploi : Dépasser l'optimisme technologique et commencer à préparer la transition dès maintenant - Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle,"Je vous partage ici le résumé d'une note d'analyse publiée par l'OIA, petit think tank français indépendant. Je trouve leur analyse pertinente et bien expliquée.

Et accessoirement même si ça commence à progresser dans le bon sens, je trouve ça dommage que le discours dominant soit encore que l'IA va simplement créer des emplois.

Et l'idée n'est pas d'être alarmiste ou de dire que ça va être l'apocalypse, mais simplement d'accepter que l'IA va avoir un impact important sur le travail en général et qu'on devrait essayer d'anticiper un peu.

Mais bon c'est sûr que c'est un problème de plus à gérer, dans un contexte déjà pas simple où les gens n'ont déjà pas assez d'espace mental pour les sujets courants comme ""changer de gouvernement""...

En tout cas c'est bien qu'il y ait des gens qui fassent ce travail d'analyse et d'explication.

Voici un résumé, je mets le lien vers le PDF en bas de page et le texte complet en commentaire :

**Source :** Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle, Septembre 2025

# I. Contexte

* L'interview de Dario Amodei (CEO d'Anthropic) en janvier 2025 a relancé le débat sur l'impact de l'IA sur l'emploi avec ses prédictions alarmantes (moitié des emplois ""juniors"" pourraient disparaître, taux de chômage de 20% possible dans les 5 prochaines années, expression ""white-collar bloodbath"")
* Les réactions se focalisent souvent sur un argument rassurant : les gains de productivité permettront aux entreprises de produire davantage, sauvegardant les emplois existants et créant de nouveaux emplois
* Cette vision optimiste, largement reprise par les acteurs technologiques et certains dirigeants politiques/économiques, mérite d'être questionnée
* De nombreux éléments tangibles indiquent que ce postulat est au mieux optimiste, au pire utopiste, et qu'il est vital d'anticiper dès maintenant les disruptions majeures sur le marché de l'emploi

# II. Un scénario optimiste reposant sur deux hypothèses clés

# Première hypothèse (cohérente selon l'analyse) :

* L'IA générative permettra des gains de productivité significatifs, notamment pour les activités de ""production intellectuelle""
* Ce postulat fait largement consensus dans les milieux économiques
* Il ne s'agit généralement pas d'automatisation complète mais plutôt d'augmentation des travailleurs (""human in the loop"")
* Les travailleurs augmentés par l'IA remplacent les travailleurs sans IA, mais l'humain reste ""dans la boucle""
* Face aux gains de productivité, une entreprise peut choisir soit d'augmenter sa production, soit de réduire ses coûts à production équivalente

# Seconde hypothèse (largement fallacieuse selon l'analyse) :

* Les gains de productivité constituent un facteur de croissance du marché, provoquant une augmentation de la production plutôt qu'une réduction des coûts
* Cette hypothèse n'est valable que dans deux cas :
   * **Cas 1** : Secteur en croissance stable avec potentiel pleinement exploité - les gains de productivité permettent de répondre à la croissance sans embaucher
   * **Cas 2** : Secteur avec potentiel inexploité - les gains permettent de ""débloquer"" ce potentiel via réduction des prix
* **Problème majeur** : Dans les secteurs sans croissance ni potentiel inexploité, l'augmentation de productivité ne s'accompagne d'aucune croissance du marché - parfois même d'une décroissance
* Cette asymétrie entre gains de productivité et évolution de la production constitue un défi économique et social majeur de la révolution IA

# III. Une disruption sans précédent par son ampleur et sa vitesse

# Analyse de plus de 200 combinaisons secteurs/activités :

* **Objectif** : Comprendre le rapport entre augmentation de productivité grâce à l'IA, évolution du marché et impact sur l'emploi

# Résultats préoccupants :

# Activités fortement impactées par les gains de productivité :

* Administration, technologies de l'information (IT), relation client, marketing et communication
* Ces gains concernent une grande partie des activités internes dans la plupart des secteurs

# Secteurs avec augmentation de production compensatrice (minorité) :

* Technologies de l'information et communication, santé humaine, transports et entreposage
* Secteurs déjà en croissance ou avec potentiel ""déblocable grâce à l'IA""
* Même dans ces secteurs favorables, toutes les fonctions ne bénéficient pas de créations d'emploi
* Certaines activités subissent même des destructions nettes (cas déjà observé chez Microsoft, Meta, Google, SalesForce)

# Secteurs subissant une destruction nette d'emplois :

* Secteurs sur marchés matures, à croissance stable ou déclinants, sans potentiel significatif lié à l'IA

# Secteurs les plus vulnérables - Trois caractéristiques pénalisantes :

* Fort potentiel de gains de productivité grâce à l'IA
* Marché mature ou déclinant
* Possibilité de réinternalisation par les clients (entreprises/particuliers) rendue possible par l'IA

# Exemples concrets de secteurs à risque :

# ""Activités spécialisées, scientifiques et techniques"" (cabinets de conseil) :

* Avec ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude : les entreprises peuvent produire en interne analyses, études de marché, plans stratégiques
* Même si la productivité augmente dans les cabinets, la demande diminue par réinternalisation
* Provoque une contraction plutôt qu'une croissance du marché

# Services administratifs et fonctions support :

* ""Double impact"" : gains de productivité chez les clients + réinternalisation des activités sous-traitées
* Les fournisseurs de services touchés par réductions d'effectifs dues à la baisse d'activité

# Secteur financier et d'assurance :

* Marché mature avec gains significatifs mais aucune croissance compensatrice
* Impact sur comptabilité, analyses financières, service clients

# Secteur juridique :

* Quand l'IA peut fournir un conseil juridique de qualité, réduction de la demande pour cas standards
* Concentration sur les cas complexes nécessitant expertise humaine

# IV. Dynamiques systémiques amplificatrices

# Impact sur les postes d'entrée :

* Les postes ""juniors"" pénalisés en premier - ceux qui permettent aux jeunes d'acquérir l'expérience
* Paradoxe : les profils juniors, plus à l'aise avec l'IA, voient leurs opportunités se réduire
* Interruption de la transmission des compétences métiers, questionnant la formation des futures générations d'experts

# Autres facteurs systémiques :

* Plafonds de croissance méconnus dans les secteurs supposés compensateurs (contraintes ressources, énergie, infrastructures)
* Concentration des bénéfices entre les mains des détenteurs de capital technique
* Diminution du poids économique des travailleurs dans les négociations

# V. ""The elephant in the room"" : La transition dont personne ne parle

# Paradoxe majeur :

* Malgré l'évidence de la disruption, aucun acteur ne prépare réellement la transition
* Absence de préparation stratégique au niveau des entreprises ET des institutions

# Au niveau des entreprises :

* Plus de 80% des dirigeants tech anticipent une réduction des embauches dans les 24 mois, mais sans plan d'accompagnement structuré
* Même les dirigeants les plus avancés admettent ne pas avoir de consensus sur les niveaux d'embauche 3-5 ans

# Au niveau institutionnel - Cas du plan français ""Osez l'IA"" :

* Budget de 200 millions d'euros pour accélérer l'adoption de l'IA (objectif 100% grands groupes d'ici 2030)
* **Aucune ligne du programme ne traite de l'anticipation/accompagnement des travailleurs impactés**
* Illustration parfaite du déni : financer l'accélération de la cause sans tenir compte des conséquences
* Contraste avec le rapport de la Commission IA (mars 2024) qui citait déjà la nécessité de ""se préparer à la disparition de certains métiers""

# Inadéquation des mécanismes existants :

* Les dispositifs (formation, reconversion, soutien chômage) sont calibrés pour des transitions sectorielles graduelles
* L'IA va impacter simultanément de nombreux secteurs et fonctions, à grande échelle et sur période courte (probablement d'ici 2030)
* L'histoire économique montre que les transitions mal anticipées génèrent des crises durables

# VI. Recommandations pour une transition maîtrisée

# Principe directeur :

* Abandonner l'illusion d'une transition automatiquement bénéfique
* Adopter une approche pragmatique et proactive de gestion des risques

# Pour les décideurs politiques :

* **Abandonner le mythe de compensation automatique** et planifier une économie post-productivité avec nouveaux indicateurs (au-delà du PIB, incluant transition et impact social/environnemental)
* **Expérimenter des mécanismes de réallocation** des gains de productivité via système alimenté par les entreprises bénéficiaires
* **Créer des ""zones de transition protégées""** où l'automatisation est maîtrisée (secteurs stratégiques, métiers artisanaux, savoir-faire irréversible)
* **Investir massivement** dans les secteurs créateurs nets identifiés avec conditions d'accès favorables pour travailleurs déplacés
* **Anticiper les risques de ""dumping social""** et coordination internationale
* **Identifier secteurs prioritaires** propres à la France et programme de réindustrialisation
* **Dispositifs d'utilité publique** pour les citoyens, particulièrement les jeunes

# Pour les entreprises :

* **Maintenir le ""human in the loop""** en privilégiant augmentation plutôt qu'automatisation
* **Anticiper effets de réinternalisation** sur écosystème de fournisseurs avec démarche transparente/responsable
* **Développer stratégies de différenciation par l'humain** (créativité, empathie, relationnel)
* **Dispositifs d'accompagnement** aux risques psychosociaux

# Pour les travailleurs :

* **Privilégier secteurs/fonctions favorables** à l'emploi avec dispositifs publics renforcés
* **Développer compétences complémentaires** plutôt que substituables (que l'IA ne peut reproduire)
* **Préparation psychologique** à nouvelle relation au travail (volatilité, résilience, adaptabilité)

# Pour la société civile :

* **Questionner le modèle économique** de transformation des gains et pousser vers modèles alternatifs de répartition
* **Exiger transparence et participation** dans les décisions impactant massivement l'emploi
* **Repenser la valeur du travail humain** au-delà de la productivité économique
* **Créer des observatoires citoyens locaux** de l'impact IA sur l'emploi

# VII. Conclusion

# Réalité de la transformation :

* La révolution IA ne suivra pas les schémas rassurants des transformations passées
* **Asymétrie fondamentale** : gains de productivité massifs et rapides vs croissance ""compensatrice"" limitée à une minorité de secteurs
* Facteurs aggravants : réinternalisation d'activités, impact disproportionné sur postes juniors
* Transition plus complexe que ne le suggère le discours dominant

# Urgence d'action :

* Plus question de débattre de l'opportunité (transformation déjà en cours)
* **Construire dès maintenant** les mécanismes pour traverser sans fracture sociale majeure
* Abandonner illusion de transition automatiquement bénéfique
* Approche proactive, transparente et coordonnée entre tous les acteurs
* **Le coût de l'inaction pourrait être bien supérieur à celui de la préparation**
* Saisir la fenêtre d'opportunité pour anticiper plutôt que subir

nep9cs7,comment,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Take profit and reinvest in the same asset?,">For example, if you are up 150% on Microsoft and plan on holding it for another decade, when would it make sense to sell half and lock in those profits, and then start to DCA back in?

I don't get the logic behind this what purpose would it serve ? The only reason to do this is if you want to realize those capital gains when you may be in the 0% tax bracket or something

However there are three outcomes

1. MSFT keeps rising and you buy back less shares as you sold , and DCA back in while the stock kept rising meaning you are missing out on gains, plus generated taxes.
2. MSFT is flat , what means you have done nothing except generate taxes, and unless you are in the 0% tax breacket you end up buying back in less because now you have to pay taxes
3. MSFT declines , this is the only case you might come out ahead , but it would have to decline more then the taxes you generate from selling. Meaning if you generate $1000 of taxes but MSFT only declines slightly and you purchase your shares back  at a $500 discount you still lose.",SirGlass,6,,,2025-09-17 15:24:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/nep9cs7/
1njct2n,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Take profit and reinvest in the same asset?,"Hi investors -
Just taking a quick poll here regarding strategies for locking in gains. Does anyone take profits and then reinvest into the same asset?
For example, if you are up 150% on Microsoft and plan on holding it for another decade, when would it make sense to sell half and lock in those profits, and then start to DCA back in?
Also, I get that this is mostly a math thing. Can anyone help me think about it in terms of the numbers?",mrmses,0,0.25,18.0,2025-09-17 15:13:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/

Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
