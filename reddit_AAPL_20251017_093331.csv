1o8oydh,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Can Brokerages Share/Sell Your Trading Data?,"Hi all,
my apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.

I've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since. Over the last ~6 years I've regularly bought SPY & VTI, and some AAPL, GOOGL, AMD, MSFT, NET, companies i am passionate about and follow intently. 

last week, i transfered some cash into my trading account and decided to disperse it evenly amongst SPY, VTI, and SCHD. Ever since, my Google News feed has been sharing nonstop reports about SCHD from websites like Seeking Alpha, Tipranks, etc... everyday, front and center in the ""For You"" panel. 

I am 100% certain i have done nothing to search, research, talk, text, or do anything inbetween to discuss this beyond just clicking the ""order"" button in the Schwab app once. 

So, how the F does google know about my recent purchase?",cornelius_cumquat,9,0.8,11,2025-10-17 04:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/
1o8cw2k,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline (most people are focusing on interest rate cuts, but ignoring this fatal truth)","The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month, but Powell's statement last night is the real bombshell, signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction. Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.

Balance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults. When the Fed sells mortgage bonds, it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings. When it sells Treasury bonds, corporate bond issuance costs also rise. This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity, which requires closer scrutiny. History always repeats itself. On the eve of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn't stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero. Ultimately, it was the initiation of Q1, or reverse balance sheet reduction, that stabilized the financial system. In his speech yesterday, Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets. This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019, when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10%, nearly shutting down Wall Street. He's clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake, and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment. On the surface, the US stock market is still rising, but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants, which together account for over 32% of the S&P 500's weighting. The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium-sized businesses are struggling with financing costs. This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate, but the patient's hands and feet are already cold. Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy. Even more subversive, halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic. When the Fed expands its balance sheet again, it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar. This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash. He didn't rush to cut interest rates back then, but instead directly injected liquidity into the market, successfully stemming the spread of the crisis. Powell's approach is now precisely the same. For businesses, this is an even more life-or-death situation. The Treasury Department issues $1 trillion in bonds every quarter. If the Fed stops selling them, it effectively lowers the government's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, giants like Apple and Microsoft, with $800 billion in cash on hand, will be in for a rude awakening. Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash, and the money they hold is quietly evaporating. So, when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts, remember the deeper meaning behind Powell's move, as quoted by Dave Reifsner, Director of Research at the Federal Reserve.

A famous governance maxim: When interest rates hit rock bottom, the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon. This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game. Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight; halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall. This move today will undoubtedly upset some. But it must be said. In the financial world, the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay. Remember, on the night of October 15, 2025, when history turns, some will hear only the wind, while others will see the shape of the storm. Now it's your turn. Are you one of the 97% who are focused on interest rate cuts, or the 11% who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction?

1o7177q,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. 

I also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). 

Their moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.

iPad: $26.69 B
iPhone: $201.18 B
Mac: $29.98 B
Service: $96.17 B
Wearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B

(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment

Doing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  

In the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to.  I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. 

TLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone 

Edit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.

1o65niu,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.

Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.

Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.

They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?

Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.

But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.

So the real question is this:
Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?
Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",TigerMCU,0,0.13,12,2025-10-14 06:09:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/
1o63dnv,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Tata Electronics acquires Chinese iPhone supplier Justech’s India unit for about $100 million, sources say","Tata Electronics has acquired Chinese industrial firm Justech Precision’s India unit for close to $100 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, as the Tata Group subsidiary bolsters its manufacturing capacity to benefit from Apple’s focus on iPhone manufacturing in India.

The transaction was concluded in August, with HSBC Bank and HDFC Bank advising on the deal, according to the people close to the deal.

Headquartered in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, China, Justech Precision has been a supplier to Apple since 2008. It provides industrial equipment, such as computer numerical control machines used for precise cutting and fabrication tasks, to Foxconn, the world’s largest assembler of Apple products.

Justech Precision Industry India, incorporated in late 2019 and based in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comments, neither did Tata Group. Tata Electronics declined to comment.

In January, Tata Electronics reportedly bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron’s India operation that operates an iPhone plant, Reuters reported. The deal’s value was not disclosed.

The acquisitions come as Tata Electronics, which began assembling iPhones in India in 2023, seeks to expand its manufacturing capacity as Apple reportedly plans to source all of the iPhones for the U.S. market from India by the end of 2026.

Apple, which still manufacturers most of its smartphones in China, has been taking urgent steps to build capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn, pivoting away from China amid higher tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Foxconn still accounts for two-thirds of India’s total iPhones shipments, with Tata making the remaining one-third, according to Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, who expects that market share could change soon as Tata scales up its manufacturing.

Tata currently operates two plants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which was formerly owned by Wistron.

# Made in India by 2026

Apple started looking for manufacturing alternatives after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown in China disrupted output at its largest assembly plant. The heightened Beijing-Washington tensions and tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the U.S. this year have prompted Apple to accelerate the shift in production.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially slapped prohibitive triple-digit tariffs on imports from China before granting a temporary reprieve for smartphones shipments. Despite India also facing high tariffs from the U.S., iPhones made in India don’t attract any duties as of now. Apple’s shift in production to India instead of the U.S. has angered Trump, who in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years worked to promote India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high-tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development.

But Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengaluru assembling older model iPhones, which saw a labor riot in late 2020.

Apple is looking to build “highly localized” partners to become “truly diversified,” instead of bringing Chinese or Taiwanese partners in India and be dependent on them, Shah said, but finding alternatives for components sourced primarily from Chinese suppliers could take years.

“It will not be a sprint to build like-for-like supplier ecosystem as it enjoyed in China, but a marathon and a step by step process,” Shah added.

India will account for around 26% of global iPhone shipments by the end of 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year, according to the latest estimate by Counterpoint.

Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Justech’s innovation exhibition center in Jiangsu during his trip to China in March where he pledged to continue to make large-scale investment in the country.

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

1o3ewij,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI,"Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned.

Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.

The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.

Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.

Xiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.

Investors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.

Prompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.

Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.

Silicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple’s deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company’s founder and other execs, and Google’s $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf’s CEO and leaders that included licensing fees.

Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple’s biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines.

Some analysts have attributed Apple’s relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps.

While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker’s foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users.

Prompt’s technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple’s HomeKit smart home division.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:
   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.*
* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:
   * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.*
   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*. OpenAI doesn't want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with* [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-google-search-trial-774f4774?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi2Aepz4YfkUzHlyW43XKFw5jYgLonf0RqC-XMCO1XblHovzKcMOxODMv7rkOY%3D&gaa_ts=68e8ec3f&gaa_sig=aoxKHEAywLIAKYAhJQLXOxevRchLEJ2gA5pO3e7p5VMHy7uJWtgMMSjRJ6U0IHEz5ppiUJPdvwSLlSbFSJdOUQ%3D%3D)*.*
   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1o2gfpp,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"
With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

 

Notable:

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48
4 Companies from 1999 had a positive return through 2006. 
5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

And recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

Not saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.

What do you guys think about this?

1o0xu4z,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Why I Think Chemours Could be the Next Big Mineral Play,"Ticker: $CC, Chemours Company

So why this company and why minerals? 

Minerals are hot right now; tariffs from the USA and China withholding critical minerals means that the world needs to adapt. Look at the example of China prevening any Gallium from being sold to the USA. This creates a need, and a need creates the market. [https://cen.acs.org/policy/trade/Firms-brace-China-ban-exports/102/web/2024/12](https://cen.acs.org/policy/trade/Firms-brace-China-ban-exports/102/web/2024/12)

Chemours is one of the biggest TiO2 companies globably. They take in ore which they refine to TiO2 to make paints, coatings, whatever, etc. Not interesting, but, they bring in a ton of ore, and recently (March 2025) they announced a strategic partnership with Energy Fuels (UUUU) to Create a Domestic Supply Chain of Critical Minerals for the United States. [**https://investors.chemours.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chemours-and-energy-fuels-forming-strategic-alliance-create**](https://investors.chemours.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chemours-and-energy-fuels-forming-strategic-alliance-create) In that article you can see Chemours has mines in Florida and Georgia where it currently gets its ores in addition to locations around the world. 

The ores are key. Now let's do some mild speculation. Here are the critical minerals for USA/Critical Minerals Alliances, [**https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/cms\_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/7/3/673/76194.pdf**](https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/7/3/673/76194.pdf)

* Cobalt 
* Graphite 
* Lithium 
* Nickel
* Rare earths (i.e. the lanthanide group and related elements)
* Gallium 
* Indium 
* Manganese
* Niobium
* Tellurium 
* Vanadium

The major minerals that contain Titanium are Ilmenite (FeTiO3), Leucoxene, and the more expensive Rutile (TiO2). Chemours is specifically leveraged to use poor quality ores. Look up there history, I am not interested in pulling it, but essentially that means they can use impure ore and refine it to TiO2. Here are some of their statements on what they receive from their mines. [**https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county**](https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county)**,** [**https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county**](https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county)

Now, let's look at one of the major ores they use, Ilmenite. Yes, this ore is primarily Titanium, Iron (I will come back to this) and Oxygen. Super boring, I know, but what are the trace minerals? Remember, they use a ton of this ore. Everytime you paint a wall, make a plastic container, build pretty much anything that is white or pretty much any color, you use TiO2; even when you use that toilet paper to shit post, guess what, TiO2! So they use a ton of this ore. So, what are the trace minerals? [https://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/ilmenite.pdf](https://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/ilmenite.pdf)

*  **Vanadium (V)** \- commonly present in small amounts (depends on source), **CHECK!**
* **Chromium (Cr)** \- often found as minor impurities
* **Magnesium (Mg)** \- sometimes present, 
* **Manganese (Mn)** \- minor amounts, **CHECK!**
* **Nickel (Ni)** \- trace levels possible, **CHECK!**
* **Zirconium (Zr)** \- occasionally present
* **Rare Earth Elements (REEs)** \- sometimes detected in low concentrations, **Not really, but CHECK** See below for support they are interested in rare earth metals **,**[**https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2022/10/17/10815713/us-chemours-starts-up-tio2-mineral-sands-mine/**](https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2022/10/17/10815713/us-chemours-starts-up-tio2-mineral-sands-mine/)

So, where does that leave us? They have announced a partnership for refining the ores and have ore with plenty of valuble resources, and they could build or are building the expertise to leverage those components. If we use are sub-room temp IQ that means, tendies! I use the braindead examples of UUUU, MP, LAC, minerals are in, a 100%, 200%, 300%, increase is totally possible. They could be a real supplier in these critical minerals. But, wait, what about all of that Iron? Here are some important uses for Iron as battery materials. [https://investor.vistracorp.com/2022-01-24-Vistra-Announces-Expansion-of-Worlds-Largest-Battery-Energy-Storage-Facility](https://investor.vistracorp.com/2022-01-24-Vistra-Announces-Expansion-of-Worlds-Largest-Battery-Energy-Storage-Facility)  
[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/apple-will-use-tesla-megapack-batteries-at-its-solar-farm-facility.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/apple-will-use-tesla-megapack-batteries-at-its-solar-farm-facility.html)

Well, the critical use of Lithium Iron Phosphate Batteries (LPF) is recent (\~5 YEAR) with critical innovation for electrical grid security. The USA will need more of those to help even and enhance the grid. But, who are the major suppliers? Why would we care about LPF? Is this a good source, Idk, I am tired. [https://www.bntbattery.com/news/top-10-global-lithium-iron-phosphate-lfp-battery-cell-manufacturers/](https://www.bntbattery.com/news/top-10-global-lithium-iron-phosphate-lfp-battery-cell-manufacturers/)

* **CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd.** China
* **BYD** China
* **Gotion High‑Tech** China
* **EVE Energy** China
* **SVOLT** China
* **REPT Battero**, China
* **Envision AESC,** China
* **Lishcen Battery,** China
* **Great Power**, China
* **Wanxiang A123**, China

Hmmm, I guess there might be a problem here. If an American company decided to start refining LPF or at least Iron for LPF, they could have a significant tariff and home town advantage. If you think Chemour is not, I think you are a fool. 

The bad: PFAS, enough said, they have the liability, but they are a huge minerals company waiting to happen.

I don't have much money left, yes I was diagnosed, so here goes what I have left for some shares!

I am creating this follow-up post thanks to the many people who have direct messaged me and also followed-up on my prior post/thesis. 

We have seen Lionsgate move over 30% up/sideways/down over the past 12 weeks. I have not moved my position as the longer term prospect thesis remains exactly the same. There is IP, a library, and revenue that single handedly will add immense value, beyond the current market cap, to any of the major players, i.e. $SONY $NFLX $PSKY $AAPL and the list goes on. 

Following near-term movement of $LION, you'll see 5-10% swings on such LOW volume that it is laughable. I expect on any real news to see this stock doubling at worst.  
  
We have moved up 25% on rumors, and 25% on other company expectations with no direct correlation to $LION.

1o0szdz,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Can you really invest more than half your portfolio in a single stock?,"I was analyzing some data on top investors and noticed that a few funds have massive concentration in just one position. CAS Investment Partners has over 80% of its portfolio in Carvana (CVNA), and Fairholme Capital holds nearly 79% in St. Joe (JOE). Even Apple shows up as a dominant holding for others, making up more than 60% of total portfolio value.

How can an individual investor realistically take on that kind of concentration and still sleep well at night? On one hand, high conviction bets have created some of the best returns in history. On the other, it’s a ton of risk if that one stock turns against you. All advisors keep on saying to distribute across sectors.

How do you all think about portfolio concentration vs. diversification? Have you ever held one stock that made up more than 50% of your portfolio? If so, how did you decide when to trim or rebalance? I’d love to hear both the success stories or not from going all-in on conviction plays.

I read some posts here discussing companies that have good growth potential. 
Often, I have not heard of those companies because they are still growing and are not mainstream yet. 

I will go and read about the companies I learn from those posts and find it very interesting. I am very impressed that someone was able to pick that company as the next big thing. 

I think it is a good skill to learn. Please suggest how I can learn it. 
How do you discover such companies? What is the criteria you use to determine that a particular company has growth potential ? 
Are there any websites or tools you recommend ?

1nwug1x,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Oct 03, 2025","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Donald Pump has pushed for Intel’s expansion, making it the greatest part of his push to bring high-tech jobs and manufacturing strength back to ‘Mueica. Not to mention, their Foundry Services are undergoing major upgrades, with alleged partnerships with rivals like AMD, which shows how vital its infrastructure is becoming to the entire industry. At the same time, major players like NVIDIA have invested in Intel’s foundry roadmap, while persistent rumors suggest Apple may also leverage Intel’s capacity in the future. This combination of political support, industry collaboration, and investment underscores Intel’s role as a strategic pillar for U.S. technology leadership.

1nvpvso,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.  
  
**Position:** 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks. ",barack_obama_jr,342,0.87,225,2025-10-02 02:53:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/
1nvg1dy,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",JuanPabloElTres,401,0.88,300,2025-10-01 20:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

1nto9qg,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Investment advice from a friend... WDYT?,"Imagine a situation. Jonny's portfolio is fully in stocks like PLTR, IONQ, OKLO, QUBT, etc... Jonny found them up on Reddit. He's happy with the portfolio being 5x in just a year, seeing how his 10k became 50k. What a deal! At night he dreams that the next year will bring another 5x and his 50k will turn into 250k. Power of compounding! He wonders if it's a good idea to take a loan and sell his girlfriend's jewels to invest in those ""5x"" stocks. When he's a millionaire, he will shower her with diamonds.

In search of advice, Jonny comes to a friend, Kattie, whom he respects for warning him about using leverage and teaching him the concept of volatility. That saved all his money in the past.

Jonny: Hey K! What do you think about that idea? I'm really afraid I'm missing a great opportunity to get rich. Those companies are sure to be the next Nvidia, Apple, and Google. I want to take a risk and go all in.

Kattie: Dude… why do you think these companies are great investments in the first place? Have you seen the financial results and checked the valuation? The P/E and P/S ratios are so insane that I wouldn't even bother looking deeper.

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking “to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse.”


While the department’s scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

“BLS will suspend all operations,” the 73-page plan stated. “Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released",thelastsubject123,1341,0.98,193,2025-09-29 18:12:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/
1ntlfop,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising

1ntjtyt,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",phoenix-of-zen,0,0.24,12,2025-09-29 16:41:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/
1nse5u1,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",timnuoa,160,0.75,133,2025-09-28 01:57:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1noliog,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Nvidia investment in a Big Red Flag,"Hi everyone, 

  
Everyone knows Nvidia invested in Open AI with 100 billions dollars. So, Open AI will get 100 billions dollars to buy Nvidia chipset for their data centers.  

If you got some knowledge about stockmarket history, this investment is typical what Cisco did with some client like ICG Communications.  
  
In the fact, Open AI is losing money and are not expecting to get money before 2028. So, Nvidia make an investment of 100 billion to allow them to buy the chipset. Yes, Nvidia makes a ""loan"" to his client because they don't have money. Cisco did the same

In AI business, lot of people make a big investment in data center because they've got money like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon ... but Open AI doesn't have the money. 

And what happen to ""cisco capital"" ? lot of companies declared bankrupcy during the .com crisis because the expected yield had never come. And Cisco will never get back the money.

Nvidia is doing the same with Open AI. And maybe with Intel ...",SidonyD,591,0.9,116,2025-09-23 18:07:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1noliog/nvidia_investment_in_a_big_red_flag/,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1noliog/nvidia_investment_in_a_big_red_flag/

1nlw4qk,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Netflix to bid on $WBD,"[https://screenrant.com/netflix-bidding-warner-bros-report/](https://screenrant.com/netflix-bidding-warner-bros-report/)

>EDIT:   
  
  
After Paramount CEO David Ellison's ""presumptive all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that ""a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \[...\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \[WBD CEO and president\] assets.""

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""implausible,"" but that ""Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now—in an attempt to preempt potential rivals—is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.""

>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo ""does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share"" and that ""neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons—that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.""

>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

Seems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",quan42069quan,300,0.9,96,2025-09-20 13:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/

1nl8km0,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Duolingo DD," Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Cash from Operations

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast. 

**The Numbers (QUARTER OVER QUARTER) (2024/2025)**

|Free cash flow|$53.7|$86.3|**61%**|
|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\~4 pts|

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

1nl1f0l,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",auradragon1,115,0.89,56,2025-09-19 13:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.


See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

1nktpuw,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,GOOG and META Bull?,"$GOOG and $META is the future of consumer i think

Both have proven their willingness to invest years and years of R&D to get us some pretty magical stuff. Don't think OpenAI with their 3 year project for consumer devices will get there any time soon... and AAPL is... asleep

Also its search business doesn’t seem to be impacted. Read the OpenAI paper , people use ChatGPT only 2.1% for shopping , and that’s where Google gets its money from

I can give plenty of examples of companies reaching it's peak like Apple, Microsoft,  the internet boom etc. 

I'm concerned it's not going to last that much longer.

1njhhw8,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Should American Investors Be Concerned About China's Slowdown?,"The most recent data from China showed that retail sales were up 3.4%, fixed-asset investment was just up 0.5%, and industrial production was up 5.2% YoY (the lowest in a year). This suggests a decline in local demand, which might have an impact on commodities, multinational corporations (AAPL, TSLA, NKE), and international commerce.

On the other hand, slower growth in China reduces inflation pressure, perhaps allowing the Fed to make cuts. Is domestic resiliency sufficient to keep stocks rising, or does this become a drag on U.S. earnings?",Ancient-Stock-3261,41,0.79,41,2025-09-17 18:13:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njhhw8/should_american_investors_be_concerned_about/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njhhw8/should_american_investors_be_concerned_about/
1njcfnv,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.
