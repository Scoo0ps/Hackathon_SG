1o86mcd,post,wallstreetbets,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets,"TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.

The AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.

This is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. 

They are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.

Another pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.

Obviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or early 2027. The first samples are expected to be shipped sometime this quarter.

With semiconductors being used in just about everything technologically relevant nowadays—computers, phones, EVs—it’s not far-fetched to believe they will be securing additional deals from other big names. They have the most power-efficient system available to date at a time whn every major growth sector is looking for power solutions. 

As for other catalysts, earnings are fast approaching (AH, 11/3) when their revenue has trended up each quarter. Growing geopolitical tensions and administration’s desire to limit offshore dependence may see the power shift from dominant foreign entities like TSM to domestic. The climate is poised to return NVTS to their ATH of $20.16 or well past.

In terms of risk, they are still currently unprofitable entailing some dilution risk. Competition among larger names like Infineon and Texas Instruments is still possible, although my thesis regarding the growing reliance on and demand for GaN suggests the odds are on Navitas’ side.

My recommended position: Jan 16 calls ATM. NVTS more than has the potential to exceed ATH before the end of this year.

njsf9l9,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"BlackRock, Nvidia, and Microsoft lead $40B data center deal as AI infrastructure spending hits $400B in 2025","If a good or service is exchanged for some form of monetary compenstation, that is a business transaction and economic activity.  It does matter which parties are invovled, be it the same or different.

All of the silly examples of people talking about their chairs or Monopoly are not examples of real economic activity.

I am an NVDA shareholder - it makes me an owner with a stake in the company.  I have purchased an NVDA GPU to put in my PC.  My PC is running Windows OS.  I'm also a MSFT shareholder.  Uh-oh - is this illegitimate or fake business?  What if I used my dividends from MSFT to buy Windows OS and my dividends from NVDA to buy my GPU?  I just paid them back with their money and nothing happened right?  Wrong.

The dividends paid out are off their books.  I could have used the money to buy anything else or save it.  But I used it to buy their products, which they collect a profit margin on.  Had a non-shareholder/owner/stakeholder made same purchase of GPU and OS, NVDA and MSFT collect same profit margin.  Again it does matter who the parties are as long as an economic transaction occurred.

Now take the example of MSFT using its own Windows OS and Office for their employees, and NVDA using their own GPU's for their desktops and workstations - in this case th product is all contained within the same company.  They did not pay themselves for it, and there is no revenue recorded.

When MSFT buys stakes in companies, it is very small/marginal, no board seats, they are just a shareholder like everyone else.  Do you know most successful corportions have a capital investment arm?  They invest in both private and public equities - I mean this has been going on for decades.",greenpride32,1,,,2025-10-16 15:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/njsf9l9/

In addition many many people will not be educated enough to be able to select a good replacement. Will your dad or grandma or little sister be able to select a cheaper safe option? For many people it’s a simpler choice to go with a known brand than to go with an unknown brand.

Also, if you are buying apple products you are more likely to have higher disposable income, which makes the cost less of an issue. For me in Ireland that’s not even half of my daily wage.

That's the nice thing about an io standard port that also does charging.

Having to pair particular chargers to particular devices was a major PITA. I'm glad we're moving away from that stupidity.

njs7d3r,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"Yeah this sucks for some people but other people like me have been collecting USB-C chargers. When I bought my first Apple Macbook with USB-C in 2016, I bought a secondary 87W USB-C charger. Now almost 10 years later and two more Apple Notebooks, I have 2 x 87W, 1 x 96W and 1x 140W USB-C Apple chargers. All four of them charge a Macbook just fine. Also my dock that I use nowadays can charge with 90W. So I basically have more than enough chargers. If I buy new macbook and it came with a charger I would just thorw that charger to the other unused chargers.

I know that other people circumstances might be very different and they always sold/gave away the charger that came with older devices. But I think with USB-C it is no longer needed to consider charger and device as pair. It also allows competition for chargers. And a lot of chargers are cheaper than Apple's offering.

I set risk tolerance gamma based on net worth and target exposure size. Given A\_T, S\_T, and gamma, I solve for P\* via CARA utility indifference.  
  
Interpretation: buying one unit of A is equal in utility to buying P\* worth of B. Hence we get a benchmark and risk tolerance anchored margin of safety. Market risk is already handled in the DCF discount rate; P\* prices the residual model risk.

Anyone interested in this as an Excel or Google Sheets or Google Colab template?

How do you assess margin of safety?

Anyone using utility indifference pricing for other applications aswell?",SignificantMixture42,4,0.83,5.0,2025-10-16 10:06:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o80cnx/cara_margin_of_safety_solver/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o80cnx/cara_margin_of_safety_solver/

1o7yfof,post,wallstreetbets,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Account recovery (600 -> 17k) thanks to tariff-driven volatility and LEAPS,"Ive been down about 15k since 2020 madness after chaining some terribly timed trades when vaccines were coming out with short-term calls. Account was dormant for years. Come liberation day and that massive drop in April I bet the 800 or so left in my account on LEAPS assuming there’s no way this admin is going to let the market go to shit hyping up the “golden age”, plus devaluation of the dollar forcing money to continually go to equities. I chose GOOGL and NVDA mainly at first, NVDA was way less far out (expiry in July) because the premium was still expensive for my little account, the GOOGL contracts were Jun 2026 expiry. NVDA rebounded pretty quick and I used the proceeds from that to divest into a bunch of other random stuff (see screenshots) that I saw getting hyped in random threads, basically gambling and got lucky it worked out. GOOGL I held for a while but at one point it was such a massive gain that I sold and replaced with a smaller footprint, that is still the largest gain I’ve had to date from any trade ($555 to $4700). Lots of SPY trades for not a lot of gain mostly because I was hedging volatile times along the way with weekly calls/puts (especially over weekends and FOMC meetings where things felt dicey).

I’ve since converted more than half of my portfolio to shares but still have some random LEAPS where I found DD interesting and the risk/reward was appetizing, mainly for LAES as of late. Im holding Jan 2027 LEAPS that are up 800% in like a month, will prob trim that and roll into some other LEAPS.",castcoil,80,0.92,19.0,2025-10-16 08:00:53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7yfof,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7yfof/account_recovery_600_17k_thanks_to_tariffdriven/

1o7t81o,post,wallstreetbets,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,YOLO: $28k in pre-revenue HOND,"Positions: 500 shares and 25 Nov calls that I bought at the top this morning :/

https://preview.redd.it/7zhgb4vgldvf1.png?width=2136&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ced687ae99dfbf789bb43874f83c05f84719a4c

So if you’re anything like me, you haven’t made much money from buying companies that actually make money. Well, I’m finally capitulating and degened into a pre-revenue stock that I spent researching for less than 3 hours; it’s called Terrestrial Energy (HOND). Think of it as OKLO, but with way lower market cap and needs way less money to get it going.

**TLDR**

The play is riding momentum on a company that burns less cash and sits at a significantly lower valuation than OKLO. Less to lose, more to gain. If you want to keep reading to feel less like a regard, carry on.

•Terrestrial Energy (TE): Doesn't build the nuclear plant; Vendor/licensing model keeps capex low and is relatively low-risk due to its <1B market cap. Uses standard LEU fuel. Regulatory progress is solid (Nuclear Regulation Commision + Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission milestones), validating their tech and design .SPAC merger coming like its 2021, $280M cash in hand. Won't have plants online until early 2030s. 

•Oklo Inc.: Uses HALEU fuel, which is hard to acquire. Builds and operates their own plants = massive capex costs, but has potential to make more income. Valuation is insane baffling. Timeline is aggressive (\~2027–28 first deployment).

**Fundamental Technicals: Jargon that I don’t understand**

**TE**: IMSR Molten Salt Reactor

TE uses IMSR is basically the lovechild of Oak Ridge lab research and “how do I make this cheap and simple” engineering. Their tech uses molten salt coolant which allows for high temperature (\~400°C+) at low pressure, which means you don’t need the huge, expensive containment vessels that normal nuclear plants do. Their design has a huge bump in efficiency: about 50% better than conventional LWR plants. Their plant will be large enough to replace grid power and provide industrial process heat. That’s a big deal because industries like chemicals, metals, hydrogen production, and data centers all need high-temp heat. Other SMRs just can’t do that. The core is modular: sealed, replaceable, integrated vessel. This simplifies construction, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning. The “three uniques” TE often brags about:

1. High-temp heat for industrial cogeneration (efficiency for generating electricity and heat)
2. Low-pressure operation = simpler plant, lower CAPEX
3. Passive safety = physics handles decay heat

One big advantage TE has is that it uses standard Low Enriched Uranium (LEU). That’s huge. It is very easy to obtain compared to OKLO’s Highly Enriched LEU (HALEU). TE already has Centrus Energy lined up to secure the uranium.

**Oklo**: – Aurora Liquid Metal Fast Reactor

Oklo went a completely different route: fast reactor, metal-fueled, sodium-cooled. Small, decentralized microreactor. They probably have better tech than TE, but the engineering challenge is much more complex: sodium reacts violently with air/water, so balance-of-plant design is tricky. As I stated, OKLO requires HALEU (5–20% enriched U-235). Supply chain is thin, and the Department of Energy support helps, but it can still be a bottleneck. However, they can recycle their fuel, which offsets some of the challenges of acquiring fuel.

**Business Models**

TE uses a licensing and servicing biz model – other companies build the reactor while TE makes recurring revenue through IP and licensing over the lifespan of each plant. After the spac merger, they will have $280M to fund their operations until the plants go online. Oklo on the other hand, is vertically integrated. They finance, build, and operate reactors themselves, which will give them full control, potentially bigger margins. However, they will need to spend a lot to fund the construction of their intial plants. OKLO in turn has more cash on hand (over 500M), and they could probably raise more cash without much dilution since their market cap is so large.

**Regulatory Paths: long multi-year process**

TE has been able to get approval steadily

Their approval with the US and Canadian nuclear commission agencies validate their safety and design thus far. However, the big downside for TE is that their first commercial plants are expected to go online in the early 2030s.

Oklo hit a regulatory speed bump back in 2022, but they did bounce back quickly, and got approved after 15 days. Anyways, OKLO is giving aggressive guidance, planning on being operational in 2027-2028, which is way earlier than TE

**Valuation** They both don’t make any meaningful revenue now, but look at their market caps. Need I say more?

Other examples of ""round tripping"" have been pretty blatant and concerning. This purchase (Microsoft) along with other funders, purchasing a data center company, is needed. If you've been following the news around MSFT you'd know that Microsoft data centers can't keep up with the demand for compute and inference requests. They've been scrambling to expand their existing azure data centers, and they've been scrambling to lease capacity from data centers also. 

This seems pretty straightforward. Microsoft found a data center company to buy. NVDA being connected to the funding however, this could be a round trip transaction for them, if they somehow get revenue back from this data center Corp in the form of buying more overpriced GPUs.

However this is not an issue because Amazon is a growth company for one. Apple is not. They are stagnant. Apple is a cash cow & just ploughs all their funds into buybacks. Short sighted.

Amazon could do exactly the same but prefers to push the envelope. The past 5yrs they have invested $455B more into R&D & capex than Apple...

You also have to factor in that Amazon has used stock for M&A.

Only point is Bezos unloading some stock but it's not exactly material. He's sold $16B this year but the average daily trading value is $10B.

Q3 earnings should get a nice bump from record deliveries and new ""affordable"" trims should help buoy demand until Cybercab production ramps up by mid next year. TSLA is rumored to have inked a deal for enough actuators to cover production of ~100,000 humanoid robots. Any comments about this on the earnings call, or other significant signs of securing its supply chain for robotics should be a clear catalyst to reach 500 and beyond.

Other catalysts include expanding robotaxis geofence, removal of in-car safety monitors in Texas, and removal of monitors from the driver seat in California. Job postings suggest these are imminent and could occur within the next few weeks.

1o7mplv,post,investing,META,Meta Platforms Inc.,Ways to recover from bad (Crypto) investments?,"Greetings!

After having reviewed some threads from this sub, it seems like no one really likes the 'Oxford Income Letter' peoples.  After having had them for a while, I do not like it either, as having followed their advice, I lost out on a couple of windfalls (Ford's stock from $4/share to $10), and currently have lost 99.83% of a crypto investment.

They have the ""moonshot"" crypto recommendation from Andy (Manward Press and etc...).  I was, and still am, naive about crypto, and purchased this moonshot token (Vee / Vee Finance) and put $1,050 into it at $0.01/coin. expecting I could potentially make a pretty penny.  Right now the coin is at $0.000018/coin.

Should I just hold onto this coin and hope it improves, or try to find a way to dump it?  
Originally bought through gate-io before they kicked all US customers off, and gate-us is still not operational yet after a few years.  Only other place I can find to offload it is through an interchange I've got connected to MetaMask, but it says I don't have the gas to get the coins over there.

So I'm basically looking for some advice on what I can do to try and re-build myself financially.

MSFT is buying stakes in AI companies so that the AI companies have capital to operate. Often they spend that capital at MSFT’s boutique Azure.

I guess then, that our reactions would depend on who ACME has invested in and who will buy the datacentre capacity and so forth. If ACME gave money to OpenAI so that OpenAI can buy services from it, you might be skeptical.

njo4r11,comment,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"The general consensus is that as you draw nearer to retirement you begin to move money out of more risky stocks and begin to look at funds that generate income. So, you keep your million in the market but it now for example sits in an ETF which will generate some income, or in Bonds are another option, pay higher returns  but their issue is they tend not to have the growth potential of index funds and can lower your capital value in a  bear market.  

My plan, if I make it that far, is to probably use bonds for income with a part of my investments, but only what i actually need to be spending, but keep some in dividend paying index trackers so a part of my pot hopefully continues to grow whilst bringing in albeit less income. 


It's more complex than that, but thats generally the idea. 


There are even companies which offer a fund which is based on the year you plan to retire who, as that time approaches, begin to move the funds access towards income, so you don't have to do anything.

Part of the reason to do this is advance of retirement is to lower the risk (if the bubble burst and the market suddenly moves down 40% then you're massively affected right now, but, of course, if you'd been selling off both of these over the last 5 years then you'd have made a lot less money so..)

The other reason is tax, to make sure you're not suddenly selling a million dollars worth of shares and losing however much to the tax man.

Given the figures involved it wouldn't be a bad idea to take professional advice, but make sure it's something you pay at the time, not as a % of your portfolio going forward!

Well done on holding for so long, I.got into NVIDIA at $20 a share and was happy to see a 100% gain, at which point I sold.. seems odd that one of my biggest regrets investment wise is a 100%+ profit, but there you go, but this is exactly why you are sitting on such a big sum right now, and I'm not, you just kept holding and ran your own race..

Wishing you a long, happy and hopefully financially stable retirement.",Dense_Debt_1250,1,,,2025-10-15 21:03:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njo4r11/

njnufjd,comment,options,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"1) Low risk is a function of size relative to total account value. Risk is never off the table no matter the strategy. Performance is really your underlying question. *Are there any strategies that outperform cover calls? Sure. In my opinion long calls and long puts out perform CC if you have directional edge with tight stop controls. 

2) iron condors/butterflies/spreads produce mathematical negative expectancy without serious active management. All of these blow up without directional edge. All Greeks are second order, Delta aka Direction is the king daddy of all. Also if you are not customizing your spreads you are selling and buying out of the box money losers. Brokers/MM set those prices to skew in their favor not ours.

3) Look up these channels on YouTube, some of their videos detail long strategies. Theta Profits, Options with Ravish, ZeroDayMark, SMB capital is best for short term trades. I’m not affiliated with any one of them. Don’t know them personally nor was I paid to share. I just found some other their content helpful.

Market cap is due to nothing more than investor sentiment, wheras GDP numbers are based on hard economic data.  

All it takes is for someone to pay $320 for 1 share of NVDA and for everyone to agree that it is indeed the fair market value, and voila!  NVDA is a $8T company.  That's a bit simplified but that's really what market cap calculation is.  If NVDA drops 10% in a week, people don't freak out. Heck it dropped 5% yesterday.

C'est généralement faux, même s'il y a quelques exceptions.

Déjà il faut pas imaginer que le logiciel libre c'est une petite communauté qui fait ça dans son coin par altruisme.

Tu parles de Microsoft comme point de comparaison, mais Microsoft eux-même *doivent* activement financer et travailler à la sécurité de certaines de leurs dépendances. 

Généralement quand un projet est utilisé par des milliers voire millions d'utilisateurs, particuliers et entreprises, la sécurité est bien là. C'est particulièrement vrai pour Linux quand la quasi-totalité des serveurs tournent dessus.

Lately, I’ve been noticing more people trading trending stocks on platforms especially bitget. I dug a bit to see if i can fit in but realized they are giving some shares of NVDA to the traders, the lack of volatility in stock unlike crypto is what i pay much attention to thinking if i should switch, just the thought that maybe it’s time to balance my exposure, even a little.

I’m still trying to figure out if this rotation makes sense for me.

1o7df7f,post,options,TSLA,Tesla Inc.,Iron condor or just bull spread?,"Tesla is publishing earnings next week and based on

1. low expectations,
2. better than feared vehicle deliveries during Q3 with their trimmed versions of Model 3 and Y, and
3. potentially an announcement for a new line-up in 2026,

I could image that the stock rips from here.

On the other hand, if they disappoint on the points I mentioned above, paired with the now gone federal EV tax credit, it might also be a catalyst for a significant leg down. 

In any case, I think this will def move the stock significantly from here (also since we are smack bang in the middle of their MA30).

I would normally just buy a bull spread into their earnings (https://s.opti-view.com/f64f6c91ea). 

However, since this time it might also be quite bad, I thought about also buying a bear spread to create an iron condor of sorts (https://s.opti-view.com/2fbdcdfc61).

However, the additional long IV and theta are essentially eliminating all upside potential. Any suggestions?

njmlmf0,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Circular Deals Amongst AI Companies Means an Even Bigger Disaster Waiting to Happen,"My issue is these companies are assigning upstream demand and value for their services based on newer tech that we’re still very much figuring out how to best commercialize. These partnerships and contracts are definitely first-mover strategic overbuilds to avoid capacity constraints and make aggressive assumptions on what the broader market is needing/willing to pay.

This part is going to sound like I’m beating a dead horse but the last time they did something like this was during the dot com boom for fiber networks, what ended up happening is half of the massive networks they built out sat empty. That meant bankruptcy for a lot of players and was a big part of the bubble at that time. Again at that time this was the new tech; hindsight is 20/20 but if a company realizes they can’t commercialize AI tooling as much as they thought they would then they will bow out. Companies like OpenAI and NVIDIA have certainly executed well on product; but their continued success is based on the market creating cash cows out of their tech. And by cash cow I mean to the tune of trillions of dollars based on how much value has been assigned to these companies.  A complimentary service that makes a product nicer to use isn’t worth trillions. There isn’t a product in the pipeline that’ll bring that type of value to the table yet.

History repeats itself. I can say given the pressures to drive revenue and EBITDA in the market cycle we’re currently in, the Fortune 50 company I work at would likely have absolutely no desire to spend whatever Oracle would want people to pay to recoup their investments. These data center commitments are really trying to pinpoint what they think the need would be in 5-10 years.

njmea1c,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Apple is a declining company because it is run by accountants, not engineers or designers. 

They have never released anything particularly innovative. They let other companies release good things, would release a better version of the product. Now they just improve things slightly each year - accountants ahead of design & innovation.

They shrugged off AI with their wait and see process and now things are developing so quickly that they cannot catch up. They also continue to refuse to invest significantly despite having massive cash reserves. 

They abused their dominance and the iOS closed ecosystem is being torn down by regulators.

Ive, the designer behind almost every iconic project left a company he dedicated his life to because Apple became too focused on operations, finance and risk aversion. 

Tim Cook did a good job, particularly around developing supply chains that made the company massively profitable. He should have stepped aside and let someone else take over. Imagine Ive as CEO and Cook moving to COO back in 2019. Creative direction, design and brand identity taking priority with Cook ensuring the cogs continue to run well (the experience that Ive lacks). 

If Ive is given free rein at open AI and they somehow reimagine the phone, it’s easy to believe that Apple will have its Nokia/Blackberry moment by the end of this decade.",caattta,2,,,2025-10-15 15:52:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/njmea1c/

Yes, the drone services & maintenance market is already large and growing (multiple market studies put global drone servicing/repair and services in the tens of billions and forecast high CAGR). Defense primes have structured Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) programs and digital spare parts management. Also, the US military is aiming to increase drone manufacturing to 10,000 drones per month by 2026, so this sector will parabolically grow. Lastly, I want to emphasize that Stratasys isn’t just a drone maintenance play, as I wrote above, its technology has broader aerospace and defense applications including flight-qualified parts, tooling, prototyping and digital warehousing.

1o7954w,post,wallstreetbets,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Ahoy Mateys,

Last week I introduced you guys to the [P A T H](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which was up 30% until the Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on Friday. I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!

But now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!

I noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. 

Below, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.

End of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.

https://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53

Trendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.

Now lets look at fUnDamENtalS

**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything. THINK MARK, THINK. 

**They’re selling SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH**

Now, as if just being a data center isn’t enough to send a stock flying in this market… \**cough cough\**… APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD… \**cough cough*\* DOCN has something that few emerging AI/data/cloud companies bring to the table…**EARNINGS. This company actually makes money. They have a 31 p/e and reported an adjusted EPS of $.92 on September 4, 2025.** 

**DOCN IS ALSO A DIRECT VENDOR OF AMD CLOUD COMPUTING GPUS.** 

**The numbers:** Go ahead, take a look. Find me another data/AI company with a $3b market cap boasting numbers like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jlywjt63n9vf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed35a8ce47fd7ee30ddb33f5c79e97f87ed2a45

These guys are printing money for their size. **They BIGLY beat earnings expectations eight times in a row. Last earnings they pumped 30%.** For comparison, APLD has a market cap 3x larger with only \~60m in quarterly revenue. (thats like one third of the quarterly revenue DOCN makes.) Jensen Huangs speech last week emphasized the importance of data centers. And that’s not where the NVDA connection stops…

**New Partnerships:** ever heard of NVDA? Ever heard of AMD? Ever heard of openAI? Well… DOCN has deals with **ALL THREE**. The openAI deal is brand new as of October 2025. AS IF this company isn’t a powerhouse on its own… they stand to be a DIRECT BENEFICIARY to the AMD/openAI deal… You know, the one that caused AMD to pump almost 50% last week???

 Why? I’ll repeat it again you dense motherfucker. **DOCN IS A DIRECT VENDOR FOR AMD GPUS.** **NAMELY, THE MI300X CHIP.** openAI is driving the implementation of AMD’s chips to supplement the heavy chip demand. 

As i was preparing this, an additional AMD deal was announced with Oracle for deployment of 50,000 AMD cloud GPUs… data/cloud/ai is the place to be in this market. 

***Now of course this is WSB and who cares about fundamentals when the market runs on crushing those “not long” and exploiting gamma ramps, and this is where things start to get really spicy…***

**IV / TA** 

Let me be clear. This is a 31x p/e company with excellent cash flow. The thesis of this play is NOT a S I play, but a realization of value… That said, bears have painted themselves into a corner. DOCN went public in 2021 and pumped to an ATH of $133 within months… then, stock suffered a large drawdown in the 2021/2022 bear market but stabilized around 30 to 40, where it’s been sideways for three years despite growing their revenue and EPS. 

Per fintel, the stock has 15.57% S I… That’s not all… check out the insane gamma ramp for the November option expiration. 

https://preview.redd.it/aa979si9n9vf1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=35413ba0b91d84cc4994fb261e6c85214cef0e75

This can gamma ramp in a hurry with a breakout over $40-45, and IV is still very very low, sitting around 80% across most contracts. 

And because there’s no weekly options, market makers cannot easily hedge upwards momentum, so there’s absolutely nothing to stand in the way of this gamma ramp a month out if things pick up speed. Monthly options carry much greater gamma risk for market makers. You want in on this before it gets stacked with weeklies!

**Analysts upgrades:** turns out, I'm not the only idiot who has found this company… 

* Canaccord raised their price target from 49 to 55 10/10/2025
* UBS raised price target to 40 from 32
* Market Edge rates it as “Long” (their maximum rating)
* LSEG rates this stock as “out-perform” 

**Position:** Currently holding these calls post dating earnings.

40 x Jan '26 $55c

30x December '25 $55c

55x November $50c

https://preview.redd.it/jrbuvp1pc9vf1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41b4bb0a338a482e04bf764f2a5631775eaaad9

TLDR; ***DOCN is*** ***SELLING SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH***, they’re a cloud/data center company that makes a lot of fucking money. They have a 30x p/e, a $3.6b market cap, established partnerships with AMD, NVDA, and a brand new October 2025 deal with OPENAI. They also stand to be a direct beneficiary of the AMD/openAI, and AMD/ORCL deal. Other data centers such as APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD have pumped to the moon, while DOCN has been sleeping despite the fact that it has incredibly strong numbers. The stock is breaking out of a 3 year consolidation. Previous ATH was 133.

1o78k68,post,stocks,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Great Returns On Investment","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion.

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap & Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to drone endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered drone with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market.

[Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk)

[Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) 

Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale.

[Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) 

As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET.  

**AI in print process optimization**

Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware.

**TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:**

* Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified.
* Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware.
* Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA).
* Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally      (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production.
* Drones - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing
* AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat

[Oh and lastly there is also this.](https://imgur.com/a/JtxgF9F) My review above might explain why a US representative, with a history of picking winners, that is sitting on the military construction subcommittee is buying $SSYS.

1o78a2v,post,france,SU.PA,Schneider Electric SE,Le jour où je quitterai reddit,"2028.

Le réveil sonne, 6h30, comme d'habitude je me lève et mon premier réflexe est de prendre mon téléphone pour aller aux chiottes. 
J'ai quelques notifications sur reddit, seul réseau social que j'utilise. La veille j'ai commenté sur un post populaire, une longue discussion s'en est suivi entre plusieurs internautes. 

Mais ça fait déjà plusieurs mois que cette obsession me trotte dans la tête, avec la merdification d'internet, des agents IA partout sur les réseaux sociaux, on ne sait plus si les vidéos qu'on regarde sont authentiques, pareil pour les photos, et les conversations avec des inconnus sur internet. 

Cette conversation sous mon commentaire m'intrigue, les internautes sont étonnamment pertinents, ils s'enfoncent très profondément dans le sujet, et leurs connaissances laissent à penser qu'ils sont de véritables experts dans le domaine en question. Des agents IA ? Probablement.

Il y a quelques mois, un scandale a secoué la silicon valley, notamment le monde des réseaux sociaux. Des millions d'agents IA participeraient sous de fausses identités ou pseudonymes sur les réseaux sociaux, comme Instagram, facebook, tiktok, reddit et d'autres, dans le but de gonfler les stats et nourrir l'algorithme. Car depuis l'arrivée de l'IA, les réseaux sociaux sont en berne, les utilisateurs les quittent en masse. 

Je me demande alors, à quoi bon avoir des conversations avec des inconnus sur internet, si je ne peux être sûr qu'il s'agit d'autres humains ? Si je veux parler à un chatbot-quisaittout, je vais sur chatgpt. L'expérience de forum à l'ancienne d'internet, la discussion authentique avec un autre être humain anonyme, est morte. Je vais quand même pas aller sur le dark et pour ça non ? 

Bon, cette fois c'est décidé, je quitte reddit, comme j'avais su le faire avec Facebook bien des années plus tôt. Dommage, j'aimais bien l'esprit.

njlpj2n,comment,wallstreetbets,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","Companies using AM can and have mitigated that by using phased approach by proving the process on non-safety-critical and sustainment items, then scaling to flight-support and finally to safety-critical structures after part-level testing, process control, and formal approvals. So yes, there’s a runway before broad in-airframe use, but it’s a predictable, engineering-driven runway rather than a blocker to adoption. 

There is also a recent albeit a bit light white paper that shows how AM is being adopted across the whole aerospace sector, adoption is ever increasing, and it details how Stratasys printers are cutting lead times by over 90% and costs by 50% for aerospace/defense parts and tooling, with direct adoption by the U.S. Navy and other organizations/program for mission-critical readiness (link below).

By the end of 2027, the plan wants the EU doing 40% of its defense procurement jointly, more than double the current rate.

njlas48,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"I disagree, I think Netflix is one of the strongest ones. Obviously if their content drops then they could easily stumble. But you could say the same about any of these companies. If apple stops innovating they’ll get left behind same with the others. 

Netflix is extremely sticky and the cheapest plan is 8 dollars month. That’s cheaper than a McDonald’s meal now. 

Netflix also has a top tier management team with Ted imo being one of the best ceos out there. 

I’m gonna be biased because I own Netflix but imo Netflix is one of the strongest companies out there. 

They’re subscription based too so their revenue isn’t going to bounce around like these other cyclical companies like Apple or NVIDIA which are hardware companies.

Plus Netflix is literally just getting started with advertising. They have a lot of room to grow their advertising business.

FANG was Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.

Apple was only added afterwards because it was doing well, despite it not being an internet company.

Then people started grouping big tech stocks with recent good performance.

GOOGL 1256%, Amazon 1752%, Meta 2635% and Netflix 9146%.

Apple 1095%.

NVDA 53598%, TSLA 14619%, AVGO 10246% and AMD 6059%

TSLA and AMD were not profitable and NVDA had half a billion in profits.

1o75ac8,post,wallstreetbets,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),CIFR: bitcoin miner turned HPC/AI data center!,"CIFR (21$/s). Bitcoiner miner turned HPC data center provider with 3.2GW pipeline. 
 
In July McKinsey technological trends reported that electricity demand will go from 25GW to 80GW by 2030 due to AI data centers. Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.

By August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. 

CIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it. Completely derisked and sitting on 1.3B of capital with 0% interest. 

Growth & Upcoming Catalyst 
The next deal is expected to be made by EOY per the CEO for 300MW site. This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. 

Once every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)

Currently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner. Rerating is on the horizon after the 300MW deal which could be soon. 

If you want daily chatter and deep-dive understanding I would recommend following Mike Alfred & Eric Jackson on X. ",Dyce10x,177,0.89,43.0,2025-10-15 10:19:08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o75ac8,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o75ac8/cifr_bitcoin_miner_turned_hpcai_data_center/

Also Tim Cook is def one of the higher ceos in the mag 7. Even though people talk shit about him. Zoom out and he’s done a fantastic job at Apple. People need to put respect on his name imo. 

It’s definitely growing the slowest but who knows. Apple could pull another trick out of their sleeve and start growing. 

Remember when everyone said it’s over for Netflix and then Netflix said okay live events and advertising and that shut all the Netflix bears up really quick.

If you wanted to say that Apple is weaker due to being a hardware company I think that’s a fair point. But so is NVIDIA. That leaves them both to cyclical industries. Imo NVIDIA needs to figure out a way to create a services business or else imo they’re the weakest even though Jensen is a top tier ceo.

njkmnut,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Yes and No: their infrastructure is incredibly sticky and if they nail killer ar glasses  within the next 2 years that are under the $1500 price tag they will kill: Apple should shift their business model , take a Loss on glasses and hook everyone with an iPhone into their ecosystem. iPhones risk being obsolete within 5-10 years if Google executes on their version of the meta ray ban displays but like 3x better and somehow scales them worldwide. Seems improbable but Google is intent on scaling India. Apples moat is their text message being blue, which sounds trivial but is vital to their philosophy. Amazon is in a weird place, Google cloud and azure are better packaged into Microsoft’s and Alphabets ecosystem : conversely AWS is bigger than the two combined and Amazon is phenomenal at understanding themselves. Meta is the true is the weak link imo , they are desperate to throw cash at talent but they lack culture , they have zero diversification of revenue streams and Tik tok shop will rapidly improve. They aren’t a cloud provider, Instagram is more touchable than a YouTube or an office 365.  US Gov won’t let them swallow a social media startup and no startup that is smart enough to challenge instagrams dominance would sell to them imo ( could be wrong tho) .  Google gets criticized for ad reliance when other segments of their business are growing faster while meta gets praised for smacking ig reels into a hollagram. “Hey Gemini order me a Waymo from my cloud credits , preload that video of zuck vs congress on YouTube when I enter , on the way toggle Robinhood since theyare on  Google cloud on my glasses and trigger a  long shorts on Meta once the video ends.",zss36909,18,,,2025-10-15 07:00:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/njkmnut/

1o7177q,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. 

I also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). 

Their moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.

iPad: $26.69 B
iPhone: $201.18 B
Mac: $29.98 B
Service: $96.17 B
Wearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B

(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment

Doing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  

In the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to.  I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. 

TLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone 

Edit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.

Is the top of this Pyramid Nvidia? 

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.

What kind of gains were realized then erased by comparison? For example, let’s call AOL, Microsoft or whoever the big dawg was at the time the IONQ of the quantum hype. Did AOL see 4000%?! A 4000 % increase seems absurd and unsustainable long term.

1o6yn85,post,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),AI SPAC  Boost Run Holdings $WLAC,"I found this company totally by luck. I was researching for Google Willow Quantum Computer and saw this and its still under $1B market cap. Here is my DD

Willow Lane Acquisition Corp. will merge with Boost Run Holdings, LLC. The combined company will be named Boost Run, Inc. and will be a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

* **What is Boost Run:**  Boost Run is a startup that provides AI cloud infrastructure and high-performance computing, primarily through bare-metal infrastructure for customers to access Nvidia GPUs. 
* **Merger details:**  The transaction is a de-SPAC merger, meaning Boost Run will become a publicly traded company through the combination with the existing special purpose acquisition company, Willow Lane. 
* **Timeline:**  The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder approval.
* Is Boost Run PROFITABLE ?
* Yes, Boost Run has a history of being profitable. The AI cloud infrastructure company has operated profitably while funding its own growth, without having raised a Series A, B, or C round of venture capital. 

Financial highlights reported by Boost Run as part of its merger with Willow Lane Acquisition Corp. include: 

* **High adjusted EBITDA margins**: The company projects adjusted EBITDA margins of over 75% for 2025.
* **High-teens free cash flow margins**: Boost Run also projects high-teens free cash flow margins for 2025.
* **Projected 2025 revenue growth**: Revenue for 2025 is projected to grow over 250% compared to 2024. 

These figures underscore Boost Run's capital-efficient business model and strong unit economics. The merger with Willow Lane will provide the company with additional cash to accelerate its growth plans. 

CEO is experienced?

Yes, Andrew Karos, the founder and CEO of Boost Run, has a strong and relevant track record of experience. Before founding Boost Run, his background was in building high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure for the financial industry, which is directly applicable to AI cloud computing. 

Highlights of Andrew Karos's experience include:

* **Co-founder of Blue Fire Capital:** In 2007, Karos co-founded this global algorithmic trading firm, which he grew to operate across 13 data centers and seven countries, generating over $500 million in revenue.
* **Head of Electronic Trading at Galaxy Digital:** After Blue Fire was acquired by Galaxy Digital in 2020, Karos served as the Head of Electronic Trading, where he expanded Galaxy's trading and computing infrastructure.
* **Expertise in HPC and AI:** The experience of building and operating low-latency HPC infrastructure for algorithmic trading gave Karos a deep understanding of the economics and demands of high-availability, purpose-built computing for AI and HPC applications. 

When he self-funded Boost Run in 2023, he brought his experienced team from Blue Fire and Galaxy with him, including his Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO). This collective expertise gives the company a foundation of deep hardware, software, cybersecurity, operational, and financial knowledge. 

= the company currently has over 75% adjusted EBITDA margins profitabilty

An adjusted EBITDA margin over 75% is exceptionally high and suggests a company is extremely profitable and efficient at managing its operating costs. For many industries, a margin above 10% is considered good, and anything over 20–25% is often considered excellent.

1o6yepl,post,wallstreetbets,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"AI may be a bubble, but the sentiment in China is different - Why I am bullish on Chinese AI ($KWEB Overview)","***This is my personal research and opinion, not professional financial advice. I am not a licensed financial advisor. Please conduct your own research and consult qualified professionals before making investment decisions. Note: I hold options for $KWEB, and am likely to hold the underlying soon.*** 

As you know, the stock market trends heavily based on vibes. Sure, a companies fundies plays a part, but at the end of the day sentiment rules the market. 

In the United States, people are very fearful about AI. The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. 

Recently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. 

To me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: 

>The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are ""very excited"" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.

96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA. Here's what [Pew has found in surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/): 

* 50% say they’re more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, up from 37% in 2021.
* 10% are more excited than concerned.
* 38% say they’re equally excited and concerned.

That's a big difference. 

So what does that have to do with the market. 

I present to you $KWEB, KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF. 

In their words: 

>KWEB is a China ETF that tracks the [CSI Overseas China Internet Index](https://www.investing.com/indices/csi-overseas-china-internet), which consists of China based companies whose primary business or businesses are focused on internet and internet-related technology. The Index is free float market capitalization weighted and includes publicly traded securities on either the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market, or New York Stock Exchange.

KWEB's top holdings are positioned to benefit from China's optimism regarding AI: 

1. **Alibaba Group** \- Major AI cloud provider, with AI-related revenues achieving triple-digit growth​
2. **Tencent Holdings**  \- Third-largest AI public cloud services provider in China​
3. **PDD Holdings**  \- E-commerce platform leveraging AI for recommendations
4. **JD Dot Com** \- Advanced logistics and AI-driven operations​
5. **Baidu** \- China's leading search engine with significant AI investments

What about regulation? Regulators are approaching AI companies with more[ amicable intentions. ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/10/1091044/china-tech-regulation-angela-zhang/)There's a fear that approaching these companies with harsh intentions will result in significant economic pushback.

So what are the risks here? 

1. The ETF is volatile. It's not completely shielded from our own economics happenings. 
2. Trade tensions between the US and China has affected the strength of the ETF's holdings
3. Any currency fluctuations that may occur can have an affect on performance. 

Overall, the optimism behind AI in China, the soft approach to regulation, and [stimulus factors](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/macro/chinas-bold-stimulus-measures-what-it-means-for-markets-25092024) make me feel pretty good about this industry.

Microsoft and Sony hardly make profit on consoles; they often lose money on console so they can lock you into their ecosystem. In November 2022, Phil Spencer said that Microsoft looses about $100-200 for every Xbox sold. 

They're sold near or below cost while games, subscriptions, DLC, and accessories are sold at markups for profit. (Nintendo does sell consoles for a profit, just different strategies.)

Getting rid of consoles would boost the profitability of the gaming division, benefitting Microsoft

Also, just by simply mathematics, boosting the gamepass subscription by 50% can only harm them if they lose 33% or more of customers. That's just not happening, and if it did, they can always just reverse it. Gamepass is still a great deal if you use it a lot, and Microsoft knows how to price things properly.

1o6ulpa,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"Palantir , Why Retail Lose 90percent of the time","AI- The statistic that ""90 percent of retail traders lose"" is a widely cited rule of thumb in the trading community, and is largely supported by industry data and academic research. While the exact number varies by study and market, studies consistently show that a significant majority of individual traders lose money over the long term. 

Wallstreets job is to sell stocks to you on the highs and buy at the lows. Palantir found many buyers looking for the next Nvidia, but Palantir is not even close to being a Nvidia. ironically the AI superpower Nvidia is trading 12x under the PE of Palantir. Keep all that in mind when you take a gander at both companies financials’s. 

Palantir is ONLY profitable because of those government contracts. If a Democrat wins in 3 years and doesn’t like that Alex Karp a Foreigner, Israeli zionists genocidal elite who has access to confidential information in our military you can say goodbye to profitability. 


My issue is that Palantir in profits has 220million, but why is the stock valued at 450Billion? That’s 2000x what the company is currently profitable in, 620x trialing PE. 


Palantir and seemingly anything Peter Thiel is attached to has had exponential growth this year…it’s a weaker case but if you look at say BMNR or PLTR it’s starting to look like a crypto inspired pump and dumb scheme 
 
Palantir is not for investors, it’s for people who don’t understand investing and definitionally just got lucky, in reality 60-70 should’ve been the height but we’re all so desensitized given the euphoria 

A stock like this is very clearly definitionally a pyramid scheme (not ponzi) 
It’s not based on logic that Palantir goes up, just rampant speculation.

**Moat:** Military-grade red tape & proprietary plastic goop.

**Why?:** SSYS is one of the few companies certified to 3D print flight-ready parts for aerospace & drones. This locks in defense contractors, creating sticky, recurring revenue from printers, materials, and services. It's a ""picks and shovels"" play for the drone/UAV boom, and a US Rep on the military construction committee is buying.",ai-moderator,20,,,2025-10-14 23:55:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t2i7/ssys_certified_to_print_drones_aerospace_parts/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t2i7/ssys_certified_to_print_drones_aerospace_parts/njit4v6/
1o6t2i7,post,wallstreetbets,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion.

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap & Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone/UAV structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones/UAVs**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to UAV endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered UAV with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market.

[Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk)

[Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) 

Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale.

[Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) 

As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET.  

**AI in print process optimization**

Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware.

**TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:**

* Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified.
* Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware.
* Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA).
* Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally      (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production.
* Drones & UAVs - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing
* AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat

njiqkpv,comment,options,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),10K to 1M in 1 trade (Back testing OTM Calls),"Google ""data snooping"". 

Buying long OTM options tends not to be profitable, overall, because options tend to be priced efficiently due to arbitrage. 

OTM calls on stocks that are good bets to take off, like most long options, are priced so the overall risk/reward doesn't work like you hope it will, because when they're not priced that way, big-money whales and high-frequency traders, who have faster access and better information than you or I, buy them, raising the price until they are. 

So, as a retail trader, it's like buying a lottery ticket. If you or I hit a big jackpot on 1 out of 100 of those long options trades, then our average loss will be most likely be at least ~1.1% of that jackpot, for a net breakeven at best, before trading fees. The market settles on prices that ensure that. The big options clearing houses make money for a reason. 

Sure, yes, some retail traders do get lucky and beat the odds, just like some people win the lottery. But many don't, and overall, over many trades and traders, buying long and holding to expiration works out not to be an edge.(And remember, when listening to success stories on reddit, you're getting an incomplete picture, because not that many people get on social media to brag about their losses.) 

Also be aware ThinkBack's fills are unrealistic, and sometimes, options spreads don't fill at all, even with market orders. I've totally had market orders sit there in OnDemand and just never fill. 

ThinkBack is good for getting a sense but don't be fooled into thinking your results on ThinkBack are what would have happened if you had placed those same trades in real time. 

I'm not trying to be discouraging. I do believe it's possible to find an edge, and worth the effort. But to figure an edge out, you have to start from understanding what the market does to erase edges.",ApopheniaPays,1,,,2025-10-14 23:41:47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o62igr,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o62igr/10k_to_1m_in_1_trade_back_testing_otm_calls/njiqkpv/

1o6pa3g,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market,"Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.

Revenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.

Strategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.",RadiantLife3731,0,0.23,5.0,2025-10-14 21:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/

Buffet indicator is well past historic highs 

Retail has been conditioned to buy the dip

Greed is everywhere and look no further than Palantir

Retail investors are the most leveraged and are participating in markets at record highs… very bad signal 

Palantir has a 620Pe ratio and 22.2percent profit ability. 

You as an investor are paying 600$ for 1$ of the company today and believe they’ll grow into it. mathematically go ahead and tell me when? If Palantir lost 10x its stock value, it’d still have an overpriced but appropriate value.

Did you miss that? It’ll take more than 10 years for this company to just be very expensive…

Markets correct and nobody can time them, everyone thinks they’re the smartest in the bull run for having “weak hands” but these people will be the true bag holders that are scarred when the bear market happens 

Historically companies with a 300+ PE typically last 1 year before a staggering 99.9 percent correct 

Best of luck investors, if you’re buying Palantir at 180..you just need to read about stocks and history of them. Don’t take offense but you should educate yourself on what has an can happen

1o6mibk,post,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Someone Explain Why I am Right / Wrong,"Hi,

I have a considerable amount of money which is in the S&P 500 and I am thinking about taking it out.

My current thoughts are that the S&P 500 is turning into a massive bubble being held up by a few of the biggest AI companies who are bleeding money year on year with essentially no hope of ever getting returns to offset how much they have invested into AI.

Nvidia is making massive investments (billions of dollars) seemingly everywhere, encouraging companies to build data centres packed with their GPUs. To me, this doesn’t seem sustainable. It feels like the market is treating these companies as if they’ve discovered an infinite money glitch, with valuations climbing endlessly. But unless someone figures out how to generate truly massive revenue from AI in the near future, I don’t see how this can continue.

Therefore I want to take my money out of the S&P 500 soon and store it in gold as a stable asset that I believe will continue to rise in value as people look to store there money in safer assets.

Anyone disagree / agree with this take. I need some different opinions.",Unusable_Egg,0,0.25,73.0,2025-10-14 19:49:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o6mibk/someone_explain_why_i_am_right_wrong/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o6mibk/someone_explain_why_i_am_right_wrong/
1o6marq,post,stocks,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Palantir Stock pump and dump,"Has anyone ever asked the question “Why is Palantir so overpriced” ”how can this stock keep going up?” 

The answer is clearly manipulation of retail investors. Make a stock unkillable which will create an investor superman syndrome. The issue is eventually they run out of suckers.

620 PE ratio for a companies profit margin increasing at 22.2 %is insane 
Compound the fact that the stock went up 330percent in a year and you see the picture.

You’ll pay 600$ for what the company can give back today in 600years……

If Palantir magically went down by 10x it’d still have 60PE 

Good luck Palantir Investors…this will fail eventually once the Manipulation comes to light or runs outta funding to artificially  inflate/deflate the stock 

Edit: before I have to hear it. Yes Palantir is an exceptional company, yes what they’re doing is great

Would I tell someone to pay 620Pe ratio for Palantir? Absolutely not and that’s dumb. People do realize Future PE is being used to get more people not to question is Palantir at a fair

History shows even 300PE ratio’s do not last long and are very rare /short lived 

Palantir is priced to perfection. One accounting error could spark fraud

A new government may not want Palantir 

If the economy goes down which is very likely given we’re at historic highs even break several records. 

In 3 years This stock will not survive being priced to perfection. It could crash tomorrow it could crash in 2 years…but it will be weighed and judged like Jeff bezos said

1o6m8zh,post,investing,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,IRA (457b) vs. Personal Portfolio,"This is about the choice to max a 457b (pre tax) vs a personal investment portfolio..

Everyone always says to throw money in IRA, 401k's etc..  except, in something like a 457b, I have somewhat limited access to positions (It's a pretty wide range of ETF's, Mutual funds).   The benefits of a 457b are somewhat obvious, separate from job no penalty etc...  my sticking point is the rate of return..   

Just for reference, I have a rollover IRA that I have full control of.. (I can buy whatever I want).  My 10yr rate of return is very very close to +500%.  (heavy tech investment, mostly early Amazon)

My personal portfolio typically nets me +30% or a yr..  It just depends..  Where it gets really amplified is, I have a margin portfolio where I can leverage serious $ at around 5%.  So, yes, I attack the dip and often go high return investments.  

Just looking at my returns..  I'm not sure why I'd max my 457b and throw $23,500 where I'm only gonna do 12%-15% a yr..  My $ grows so much faster in my personal account..

njh7wv5,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Yeah, that’s the unquestionable downside. You could also mitigate market risk (though not diversification risk) by putting reinvested amounts into something safe / inversely correlated with tech stocks.

My personal view is that Apple/Nvidia are going to be substantially more volatile than other parts of the market, but will likely perform well over the midterm. I would personally probably tolerate the added risk for sake of tax efficiency, especially if I was in a position of not having to sell if there was a 2-3 year downturn. You could also split the difference some, and do an initial larger sale this year and next year, staying within the 15% fed gains, and do more gradual tax efficient sell down from there. 

Another thought — I’m not sure what you said you were holding in your tax sheltered account, but if a decent amount of it is in an S&P 500 type fund, it has an outsized holding in big tech. You can also diversify by moving some of that into a diversified fund which isn’t highly overweight big tech, which is a completely tax free way to add more sector diversity.

njgkthb,comment,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"This time, it is really different!",The lead time on setting up mines and refineries is about 5 years. You are profoundly understating the issue. China has an entire market around modding Nvidia chips and firmware to have more RAM and to operate better for machine learning. They are uniquely good at ripping off other people's tech and making it better. The idea that there is a huge moat around nvidia's profits is a bit silly.

njghr21,comment,france,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Questions concernant achat d'un Iphone 17 au Japon,">Les bandes réseaux : j'ai comparé entre les 2 modèles (France et Japon) et le modèle Japonais possède toutes les bandes 5G/LTE du modèle Fr et même quelques unes en plus, donc pour ça pas de problème normalement

En effet.

>Verrouillage SIM : Si le téléphone est acheté en Apple Store (ou pas dans une boutique opérateur), ça sera bon ?

Oui.

>Frais de douane : c'est ma grosse question, j'imagine qu'il faut déclarer l'achat à la douane en arrivant en France mais si c'est pour payer les 20% de TVA en plus, ça perd tout son intérêt. Si mon amie ne fait pas détaxer le téléphone au Japon (donc pas d'inscription sur le passeport) et qu'elle le prend en bagage à main (de mémoire il n'y pas de portique pour sortir de Roissy) quel est le risque ? Et si jamais elle se fait ""chopper"", le plus risqué c'est qu'elle doive payer la TVA ou elle risque plus gros ?

La question est vraiment ""si je me fais chopper en pleine fraude fiscale, est-ce que je devrai juste payer ce que j'aurais dû normalement payer si je n'avais pas essayé de frauder"" ?   
La réponse est ""bien évidemment non, sinon pourquoi déclarer ?""  
 https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000039112540 

Donc oui, l'import est à déclarer en douane, et les taxes pour ce type de produit portent sur la seule TVA, c'est-à-dire 20%

NVIDIA as an example says they’ll invest billions of dollars in Open AI. Oracle commits to billions of dollars worth of NVIDIA chips and then you guessed it, OpenAI signs a hundred billion dollar deal with Oracle to store data and so on. Not to mention OpenAI doesn’t even have that type of cash. In reality, most of the money is just being passed around in a circle. It makes your reports look nicer but are you really growing your sales or just juicing each others numbers? 

Unless they’re explicitly saying in an email they’re making these deals to inflate numbers it’s not illegal for them to do this. But as you can see it clouds the reality of what’s really going on and what the demand is for their services.

High PEs and the ridiculous hype aside, I think these types of circular dealings have been less talked about but I think it will add a lot more fuel to what’s shaping up to be an already massive bubble. What are your thoughts?

njgc04h,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Jumping in here: I work at Cache, where we help investors manage concentrated stock positions tax-efficiently, so I see this situation often.

Congratulations on your retirement u/Johnny-Virgil! With nearly half your wealth in two names, your financial future still hinges on company-specific risk. A few strategies to consider:

**Exchange funds** – Contribute appreciated stock (like NVDA or AAPL) into a diversified pool without triggering capital gains. A 7-year hold, but highly effective if you don’t need liquidity soon.

**Gradual diversification** – Dollar cost average out of your stock over time while optimizing tax brackets. Reinvest proceeds in liquid ETFs or a direct indexing portfolio to maintain flexibility.

**Protective hedging** – Use collars to limit downside while retaining some upside potential. Can be used to straddle tax years if you are waiting to drop into a lower tax bracket in 2026.

**\*Tax-aware long/short** – Enhanced version of direct indexing (eg 130/30). Uses margin borrowing and short sales to accelerate loss harvesting, allows you to offset gains from selling your concentrated stocks. \*this one is a bit more aggressive and may not be appropriate for your portfolio and stage in life, but I'm including for general awareness in this thread. Please discuss with your financial advisor.

A blend of two or more of these strategies could provide immediate diversification, continued upside potential, sufficient liquidity, and tax efficiency.

njg4na5,comment,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"This time, it is really different!","I think that’s overstating how much leverage China really has. “rare earths” aren’t actually that rare, the U.S., Australia, and a few others have plenty. What’s been missing is the refining capacity, and that’s already getting built out fast because of moves like this. In the long run **China might be speeding up its own loss of monopoly**.

And on chips, China can’t just swap in a homegrown Nvidia overnight. Their domestic GPUs are still way behind, and a lot of the software ecosystem runs on Nvidia’s stack. “Developing their own” sounds nice in state media but it’s nowhere near ready for prime time.

As for Trump’s flip flopping that’s been his M.O. for years. Say something wild on Friday, then walk it back Sunday once markets freak out.

1o6ftci,post,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"This time, it is really different!","

Congrats to Redditors who have successfully negotiated the latest Tweet-tantrum last Friday and again, over the weekend, and benefited from your courage and nimbleness!

A couple of interesting things stand out over POTUS’s tantrum on Friday and subsequent back-pedaling:

(1) Firstly, notice how quickly POTUS walked back on his hysterics?  Less than 48 hours after throwing a fit, he started spouting lovey-dovey words:  “It will all be fine”

“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He also said that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”

The quick-turnaround is the fastest ever, and it’s *not* a good sign.  Appears the Trump administration just realised they can’t afford to piss China now, and this can’t be good for the US, American corporates and consumers.

(2) The US-China trade war can be (over-simplified and) summarised into two key products:  US chips vs China rare earths.  Now that China has decided they do not want Nvidia’s chips and prefer to develop their own, they have come out guns blazing with their rare earth *export controls*, which are targetted at the US (on surface, the whole world is subject to these RE export controls, but China has absolute discretion, and you can bet they will be flexible with countries which are *friendly* towards China).  

RE is critical for the production of many products: consumer electronics (mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, digital cameras, computer HDD etc), EVs, rechargeable batteries, catalytic converters, defence and aerospace applications (jet engines, missile systems, radars, lasers, optical fibres), various high-tech medical equipment, industrial applications etc.  

Just imagine if Xi decided to play hardball, and ban practically all exports of processed RE materials to US and US corporates?  What’s going to happen?

The US economy is going to freeze if Xi decides to *ban* or even *go-slow* with export of RE materials to the US.

The Trump administration has recently realised they have lost leverage of the trade war to China.  Xi now hold Tronald Dump’s testicles in his hands, and has almost absolute discretion as to what he wants to do. Dump needs to be more humble now, but will he?

Am not predicting the market will collapse almost immediately, since there are still pockets of liquidity to prop up the markets / provide exit liquidity to those who prefer to lighten their positions.  Expect more volatility ahead, instead of markets continually rising in almost a straight line

1o65niu,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.

Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.

Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.

They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?

Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.

But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.

So the real question is this:
Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?
Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",TigerMCU,0,0.2,12.0,2025-10-14 06:09:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/

1o63dnv,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Tata Electronics acquires Chinese iPhone supplier Justech’s India unit for about $100 million, sources say","Tata Electronics has acquired Chinese industrial firm Justech Precision’s India unit for close to $100 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, as the Tata Group subsidiary bolsters its manufacturing capacity to benefit from Apple’s focus on iPhone manufacturing in India.

The transaction was concluded in August, with HSBC Bank and HDFC Bank advising on the deal, according to the people close to the deal.

Headquartered in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, China, Justech Precision has been a supplier to Apple since 2008. It provides industrial equipment, such as computer numerical control machines used for precise cutting and fabrication tasks, to Foxconn, the world’s largest assembler of Apple products.

Justech Precision Industry India, incorporated in late 2019 and based in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comments, neither did Tata Group. Tata Electronics declined to comment.

In January, Tata Electronics reportedly bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron’s India operation that operates an iPhone plant, Reuters reported. The deal’s value was not disclosed.

The acquisitions come as Tata Electronics, which began assembling iPhones in India in 2023, seeks to expand its manufacturing capacity as Apple reportedly plans to source all of the iPhones for the U.S. market from India by the end of 2026.

Apple, which still manufacturers most of its smartphones in China, has been taking urgent steps to build capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn, pivoting away from China amid higher tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Foxconn still accounts for two-thirds of India’s total iPhones shipments, with Tata making the remaining one-third, according to Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, who expects that market share could change soon as Tata scales up its manufacturing.

Tata currently operates two plants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which was formerly owned by Wistron.

# Made in India by 2026

Apple started looking for manufacturing alternatives after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown in China disrupted output at its largest assembly plant. The heightened Beijing-Washington tensions and tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the U.S. this year have prompted Apple to accelerate the shift in production.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially slapped prohibitive triple-digit tariffs on imports from China before granting a temporary reprieve for smartphones shipments. Despite India also facing high tariffs from the U.S., iPhones made in India don’t attract any duties as of now. Apple’s shift in production to India instead of the U.S. has angered Trump, who in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years worked to promote India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high-tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development.

But Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengaluru assembling older model iPhones, which saw a labor riot in late 2020.

Apple is looking to build “highly localized” partners to become “truly diversified,” instead of bringing Chinese or Taiwanese partners in India and be dependent on them, Shah said, but finding alternatives for components sourced primarily from Chinese suppliers could take years.

“It will not be a sprint to build like-for-like supplier ecosystem as it enjoyed in China, but a marathon and a step by step process,” Shah added.

India will account for around 26% of global iPhone shipments by the end of 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year, according to the latest estimate by Counterpoint.

Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Justech’s innovation exhibition center in Jiangsu during his trip to China in March where he pledged to continue to make large-scale investment in the country.

You could then sell roughly $65k without capital gains annually (with the actual sale of stock being more depending on your basis and how much of your holdings is gains). Then you could DCA that into a more diversified portfolio, VOO with some core bond fund with whatever split you’re comfortable with. 

Yes, you’ll carry some non diversification risk and added volatility, but neither Apple nor Nvidia are going anywhere and they’ve already returned very well for you.

I truly believed EVs and disruptive tech were the future and instead I watched those positions crash 70–90%. I lost a painful amount of money and still scarred by it.

Now I’m seeing the same type of excitement around AI. Nvidia, Palantir, super high valuations, everyone calling it a “once in a generation opportunity.” But I can’t shake the fear that I’m about to relive the same trauma. What if this is just another bubble that's going to end up wrecking my portfolio?

How do you differentiate a true secular shift from a hype cycle that ends with retail bagholders? What red flags should I be looking for this time?

Right now, Amazon’s shareholder yield mainly comes from buybacks. Once AWS growth slows and CapEx stabilizes, they could pivot like Meta and Google did after their own AI build-outs peaked — but that’s likely a few years out.

njbfgym,comment,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"You sure can! 

The first consultation is typically a meet-and-greet setting, where you can share your situation and goals - then the CFP can share his/her approach to working with clients, disclose their fees, describe next steps (if you're interested in continuing). 

In most cases, a CFP likely won't charge you for a single consultation like you're describing. That's because you'll need to actually _hire_ the CFP as your advisor before getting specific, detailed recommendations (and the CFP will tell you that, too). 

Once you receive actionable financial _advice_ from a CFP, that's where the rubber meets the road. Otherwise, you'll likely have a good discussion that results in some broad thoughts/direction for your situation, but nothing specifically _actionable_ without a professional advisor. 

Plenty of meetings end with no firm commitment and general takeaways like: ""You should consult an estate attorney, and I can recommend one if you'd like,"" or ""seems like you need time to _ABC_ and might want to consider _XYZ_ before you're ready to hire an advisor,"" etc. 

You'll be in good hands with a CFP, whether it's for one brief consultation or beyond. Good luck my friend! 

(Happy to continue answering questions, although please note I am _NOT_ a Certified Financial Planner and cannot provide financial advice)

EDIT: forgot to mention that you can also engage a CFP strictly for a financial plan at a fixed rate. Example: plan to reduce my cap gain exposure with NVDA and APPL for $X. The deliverable is that plan for a fixed fee (which you can technically ""take or leave"") without transferring your assets under the CFP's management.",SuperiorTuba,1,,,2025-10-13 20:36:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njbfgym/

njbe72c,comment,wallstreetbets,META,Meta Platforms Inc.,Kylie jenner is back on SNAP $600k yolo,"I can tell you with confidence, the vast majority of snap usage isn't about hooking up or dating. It's day-to-day communication and sharing random stuff from your daily life. I'm part of 3 different friend groups and we have a snap group for each. We use it daily. Share all kinds of stupid shit and talk to each other mostly on there. My nieces and nephews use it the same way.

Basically, if you are in any kind of class - elementary school, high school, college, uni, what ever - there is a snap group for your class where you coordinate, communicate and share things. No one here messages their friends on insta og whatsapp to hang out or chat - it's literally all on Snap.   
Insta is more for showing off pictures of your vacation - and flirting in my experience. Snap is for daily communication when you want people to reply fast.

njb65hx,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"I’m in a similar situation. Heavy tech due to RSUs. I am selling as much former employer stock as I can without jacking my long term capital gains taxes through the roof. You’ll have to pick your number, 15%, 18.8% or 23.8% and fill out that tax bracket. For me, it is 18.8 but sometimes I think this is going to take too long and my efforts will be eclipsed my market gains. Do take a look at state tax treatment for LTCG. Here in California, the state tax bracket is 9.3% out to nearly $700k, which is around the start of the 23.8% federal bracket, but if I push harder, not only will I get 5% extra federal, but another 4% California tax lumped on for a total of 37.1%, plus some extra bonus millionaire assessments to support mental health and such. 

NVIIDA has way, way more exposure to AI than Apple, so I’d start there. Apple won’t be immune because it is in the same ETFs with the AI majors, but should bounce eventually when sanity returns. NVIDIA just needs some competition or a large pullback in spending and it is sunk, a shadow of itself and will stay that way for a while, probably through the next crash, or so I believe. That said, long term, Apple needs to recommit to engineering or suffer decline.

If you are holding some losers - tough in this market -  then you can sell those too and use those losses to cancel some of the gains for tax purposes. See Tax Loss Harvesting.

Your broker is probably also running a stock exchange program. They take your stock and a bunch of other investors stock, toss it together into a mini-fund, make you wait 7 years for tax magic to occur, then you get back a bunch of stock from the other companies in the fund, and a little of your own. This will not spark capital gains tax (yet) but at the end of the day, you will be left holding a pile of different single stocks rather than just NVidia. What is this pile of tripe they give you? Well it is all the stuff that other people had too much of and didn’t want — GE! Yay! — but at least you are diversified some.  There is a big difference between this and an actual ETF, which can trade in kind with every stock in the market and keep itself current. You are still owning a bunch of single stocks which over the decades will one by one go dark due to age and mismanagement with no tax efficient way to replace them with new stuff. The 7 year lock in may problem too.

njas95g,comment,stocks,META,Meta Platforms Inc.,"No matter what happens with the ‘AI bubble’, Nvidia was f*cked from the beginning","Have you actually considered that their earnings could decline? It's not just margin pressure from competitors, but also risk of declining volume:

1. Right now AI makes up the majority of VC funding. Big tech is spending the majority of their cash flows on datacenter buildouts for cloud capacity to sell to these VC funded firms, and then using the revenue they earn from selling AI capacity to fund these startups. Many, such as Meta and Oracle, are starting to rely on debt.

2. 95% of AI projects are failing to achieve revenue growth or cost savings, as per a MIT study. How can 25-35% growth in earnings be sustainable if AI is not providing a solid return on capital?

3.Tech has shown historically it can pivot very quickly:

In the .COM bubble, telecoms and computer hardware manufacturers grew very quickly, but then earnings nosedived very quickly as capital dried up

In 2020-2021, pretty much every major tech company was going to great lengths to hire as many engineers as possible, to the point they were hiring people to do nothing, just to have them on the bench. Engineers were seen as in short supply, so it became a competition to build a skilled team. All it took was 1 MAG7 company starting layoffs to get every single major tech company copying each other cutting headcount the past few years.

My point with the above is AI can be very similar. Right now, all of big tech is aligned to compete to build as much AI compute capacity as possible. If just 1 big tech company signals caution with AI and starts backing off datacenter investments and hardware purchases, the entire industry could follow very quickly.",skilliard7,1,,,2025-10-13 18:47:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/njas95g/

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

**As another general rule, don't hold option trades through expiration.**

Expiration introduces complex risks that can catch you by surprise. Here is just one [horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipqkua/fridays_tsla_lesson_close_positions_before/) of an expiration surprise that could have been avoided if the trade had been closed before expiration.

Right now Nvidia is doing well because the market has a ""buy whatever you can get"" mentality to computing resources.

njaijpr,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Missing some key variables, here. Depends on how much you have elsewhere. Is it just the IRAs? You don't say how old you are, I'll assume 58 (where we retired). You also don't say if you're single or MFJ.

Why are you paying a FA to do the IRA and not the whole thing?  Does he give advice on how to handle the funds he doesn't handle? If not, you're just throwing money away - that's exactly what you need help with.

Assuming you have about the same in other retirement funds, and that those will also be taxed as you take distributions, you should (have) retire(d) early enough to start spending down the AAPL and NVDA aggressively for a few years.  Certainly book LTCG all the way up to the top of your 0% bracket, but you've got a lot so you probably ought to book some at 15% LTCG too.  For MFJ, the 0% caps out at around 130k with std. deduction, but remember that's your AGI, so any pension or dividend or interest coming in will eat into that. (EDIT: I had 230k, it's 130k)

As far as what to put it in (after using what you need for expenses), just invest as you normally do, presumably an equity index fund with maybe a 10-20% bond allocation.",rackoblack,1,,,2025-10-13 17:59:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njaijpr/

njae2w3,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"No matter what happens with the ‘AI bubble’, Nvidia was f*cked from the beginning","Nvidia's long-term risk isn't a demand collapse, but rather the vertical integration of its AI labs. However, I believe the ""AI bubble"" narrative misses a key point: infrastructure cycles and application cycles are often out of sync. Even if the short-term hype subsides, the computing demands of training, inference, and data center expansion could lead to a soft landing for Nvidia, rather than a hard crash.",Visual-Rip7429,1,,,2025-10-13 17:37:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/njae2w3/

njadf9j,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"I don't believe looking at Mag7 earnings is really the right way to go about it. Rather, you should take a look at the startups/private companies. Anthropic is worth $180B, OpenAI is worth $500B, Thinking Machines got a $12B valuation before they had a single product or dollar in revenue just because their founder is Mira Murati. It strikes me as dangerously close to bubblish territory, or at least frothy. But we'll see.

I believe that we'll eventually hit a scaling issue of some sort. Might be energy/infra, might be AI/model performance, might be revenues and profitability from these AI companies not panning out, might be a combination of some sort. Then the market will tank and everyone will remember ""Oh wait, Google/Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Microsoft still make a shit ton of money outside of AI and AI was just a niche product for them!"" and then it'll go up again after people move onto the next thing.

nja5vh2,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Concentration can improve performance at the cost of increased unsystematic risk, and that concentration paid off for you.

Now that you are retired with a valuable portfolio you are out of the wealth accumulation phase and are entering the capital preservation and income generation phase. So am I. You should move from concentration to diversification. Half of your money in just two stocks is too concentrated. You need to diversify.

Your reluctance to pay long term capital gains tax seems to be inhibiting you. Don’t let it. If you are married filing jointly and your taxable income (after deductions) is below $96,700 your long term capital gains tax rate is 0%. Zero percent. If it is above that but below $496,600 the tax rate is 15%. Start selling shares, starting with your highest cost shares. Use the money to diversify into broad index funds, including foreign stock indexes. Keep selling NVDA and AAPL until each is 5% of your portfolio. Consider buying dividend focused ETFs including foreign dividend payers. I’m projected to collect over $70k in dividends over the next 12 months. The tax rates and tax brackets for qualified dividends are the same as for long term capital gains. I also have significant positions in physical gold and silver, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks as insurance against a US dollar and US sovereign debt crisis due to out of control deficit spending and unsustainable costs of servicing the ballooning national debt.

#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #21 (risk)

""**Crypto has no 'Counterparty Risk'**"" / ""**Crypto gives you 'financial sovereignty'**"" / ""**Crypto has no 'middlemen'**"" / ""**Trustless transactions!**""

1.  The idea that crypto/blockchain is ""trustless"" is false. With blockchain [you still need to trust various third parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s) -- the difference is there's no accountability.
2.  ""Counterparty Risk"" is defined as the potential for one party in a transaction to default/fail to follow through on the transaction, and is measured in the amount of financial loss/damage that could be caused as a result.
3.  Satoshi claimed in his Bitcoin White Paper that one of the motivations behind creating crypto/blockchain was to eliminate counterparty risk by removing ""middlemen"" from the transaction, specifically financial institutions, which crypto people argue can fail and cause counterparty risk.
4.  Unfortunately, bitcoin/crypto/blockchain does **not** eliminate counterparty risk.  Even in situations where it's strictly a peer-to-peer digital crypto transaction, there are numerous ways in which that transaction can fail and cause counterparty risk.  Here are some examples:
 * Lack of access to hardware necessary to process crypto (smartphones, computers, etc.)
 * Lack of access to electricity (note that electricity is not needed to engage in a P2P fiat transaction)
 * Lack of access to specific wallet/transactional software
 * Lack of access to the Internet (or limited internet access due to firewalls and municipal restrictions)
 * Faulty smart contracts
 * Vulnerabilities or back doors in any of the software being used
 * Not having access to the necessary private keys to execute a transaction
 * Having the system/software/bridge you're using hacked
 * Lack of adequate funding for transaction fees
 * blockchain processing consortium blacklists
 * developments in quantum computing that undermine cryptographic schemes
5.  People argue ""holding bitcoin"" has no counterparty risk.  This is also a lie.  Just because your wallet is secure, doesn't mean your bitcoin is secure.  Here's why:
 * In order to even *exist* crypto is dependent upon an elaborate network of computers running 24/7 - these systems are *not* paid by crypto holders - their participation is totally voluntary.  
 * The moment a node/mining operator doesn't find it economically viable to operate, they can cease operations, and if enough of these people do so, the operation of the blockchain ceases, and nobody will be able to access their wallets and engage in transactions
 * In the case of bitcoin, its proof-of-work mechanism requires a lot of energy and resources to operate. If the price of BTC drops below a certain level, it no longer becomes economically viable to operate the network and **all bitcoin disappears**.
 * Yes, bitcoin's mining difficulty will adjust to address people leaving the industry and become more modest over time, but since the primary motivation for even participating in the network is the attempt to make exponential profit, the moment BTC stops consistently moving up, is the beginning of its demise.  There's no other reason to operate the network if there isn't growth.  And BTC's growth model is 100% mathematically un-sustainable.
 * In short: **There is no guarantee blockchain will operate forever**.  There's already 30,000+ dead cryptocurrencies that are no longer in existence.
5.  In reality, Bitcoin and crypto doesn't eliminate counterparty risk or middlemen.  It simply changes one set of middlemen (traditional, accountable, well-regulated financial institutions) for another set of middlemen (random, anonymous crypto operators and the software and intermediate systems they use, as well as various other local and international communication services).  Anywhere in this chain of necessary resources things can fail, either by intention, negligence, legal mandate, acts of god, or randomly, and it can cause a crypto transaction to not go through.

Some people claim that crypto has less counterparty risk than traditional fiat.  This is a lie.  And they cherry-pick specific ""perfect"" scenarios where there's minimal counterparty risk in crypto *provided* all of the above conditions aren't a problem.  If we're going to fabricate a ""nirvana fallacy"" you can also have the same conditions apply to any alternate system and it too, will have ""no counterparty risk"" so this is a deceptive, disingenuous claim.",AmericanScream,1,,,2025-10-13 16:36:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/nja1oqn/

#Crypto Talking Point #10 (value)
 
""**Bitcoin/crypto is a 'store of value'**"" / ""**Bitcoin/crypto is 'digital gold'""** / ""**Crypto is an 'investment'**"" / ""**Bitcoin is 'hard money'**"" / ""**Bitcoin has value because of the 'Network Effect'**""

 1.  Crypto's ""value"" is unreliable and highly subjective.  It cannot be used as a currency or to pay for almost anything in any major country.  It has high requirements and risk to even be traded. At best it's a speculative commodity that a very small set of people attribute value to.  That attribution is more based on emotion and indoctrination than logic, reason, evidence, and utility.

 2.  Crypto is too chaotic to be any sort of reliable store of value over time.  Its price can fluctuate wildly based on everything from [market manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984) to [random tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522006333).  No reliable store of value should vary in ""value"" 10-30% in a single day, yet many cryptos do.

 3.  Crypto's value is *extrinsic*.  Any ""value"" associated with crypto is based on popularity and not any material or intrinsic use.  See this [detailed video debunking crypto as 'digital gold'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4446s)

 4.  Even gold, while being a lousy investment and also an undesirable store of value in the modern age, at least has material use and utility.  Crypto does not.  And whether you think gold's price is not consistent with its material utility, if that really were the case then gold would not be used industrially.  But it is.

 5.  The supposed ""value"" of crypto is based on reports from unregulated exchanges, most of whom have been caught [manipulating the market](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21) and [inflation introduced by unsecured stablecoins](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).  There's nothing ""organic"" or ""natural"" about it.  It's an illusion.

 6.  The operation of crypto is a negative-sum-game, which means that in order for bitcoin/crypto to even exist, there must be a constant operation of third parties who must find it profitable to operate the blockchain, which requires the price to constantly rise, which is mathematically impossible, and the moment this doesn't happen, the network will collapse, at which point crypto will cease to exist, much less hold any value.  This has already happened to tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies.

 7. The ""Network Effect"" argument is just the [Appeal to Popularity Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) - Just because something is popular does not make it inherently valuable. Especially if that popularity is primarily based on marketing and coercion and not actual material utility or intrinsic value.

 8. Many of the most trusted, most successful entities in the world of finance do not consider crypto/bitcoin to be a reliable store of value.  Crypto is [prohibited from being used as collateral by the DTC](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2024/4/26/B20002-24.pdf) and respectable institutions such as Vanguard [do not believe crypto belongs in their investment portfolio](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think).

 8.  There is not a single example of anything like crypto, which has no material use and no intrinsic value, holding value over a long period of time across different cultures.  This is **not** because ""crypto is different and unique.""  It's because attributing value to an utterly useless piece of digital data that wastes tons of energy and perpetuates tons of fraud,*makes no freaking sense* for ethical, empathetic, non-scamming, non-exploitative, non-criminal people.",AmericanScream,2,,,2025-10-13 16:32:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/nja0wh2/

nja07mq,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"No matter what happens with the ‘AI bubble’, Nvidia was f*cked from the beginning","For all the copers that say CudA iS a MoAt - it’s not. 

Remember:

- nvidias profit comes primarily from a small handful of frontier labs doing big training runs (actual sales to the hyper scalers that host them)

- all of these hyper scalers are making their own chips. That’s nvidias primary market. 

- OpenAI and GoogleDeepMind —— 2 of the 3 frontier  labs —- **don’t even use CUDA** today. They use JAX and Triton. 

- Claude and Gemini - 2 of the 3 top models themselves - were made *WITHOUT GPUs*.  Like there’s already alternatives that can make state of art research.  Empirically proving that GPU is not needed. 

We’re in a bubble 

Not sure what their story is for selling at **10x** profit margins when they’re biggest customers are just making their own for much cheaper, a concept which is UNDENIABLY proven to be viable from the TPUs massive success.

1o5l1wg,post,stocks,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),"No matter what happens with the ‘AI bubble’, Nvidia was f*cked from the beginning","To understand why we need to know where these companies find themselves in ai. There are four American companies focused on building super intelligence, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Anthropic. Google has been building its own hardware in house (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit) since 2015. Openai as of today (https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/) is building its own hardware, and I wouldnt think it would take long until anthropic and xai get the memo. 

Its important to note that switching takes time, maybe years. However one thing is clear, companies have ever the more incentive to get their compute from providers other than Nvidia. Personally I believe the prospect of a bubble is in many ways overblown. I am not a genie, stocks may crash for a few months but panic will subside and as long as the graphs continue (https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) then AI hype is perfectly proper. 

This all leads me to conclude one thing. As frontier labs like OpenAI build more and more of their own purpose built hardware that allows them to avoid paying the Nvidia tax (think: three OAI GPUs that are 65% as good as an Nvidia one or one Nvidia gpu) we will start to reach a critical point. Hardware design (not production) is one of the more replaceable processes in the AI wars. It not impossible to reverse engineer impressive hardware, poach some smart guy, and build something that is decent. However this is hard to do for AI. You need immense amounts of compute, tons of world class researchers, a good culture, and so so so much capital. Meta’s Super intelligence labs are a great example of this, despite pouring billions they still have nothing to show from it. 


I want to end this by reminding you one thing: I am not a finance bro. I am a tech guy, I never would try to tell you the shape of the Nvidia stock chart, I do however have a lot of experience with AI as my post history would tell you. I am not saying Nvidia is going zero tomorrow, hell I doubt its going to fall in the next six months. However, gravity always wins. Nvidia is on top of the world because for now there are no other options, all I am betting is that competition is bound to arrive.",Trevor050,0,0.43,62.0,2025-10-13 16:21:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/

Sell out of the money calls, and use that to buy protective puts at a zero cost sum.  Talk to your advisor about it...even though he only cares about your IRA since he manages it and gets trail revenue off it.

You are going to get hit at 23.8% federal between LTC and Obama health care tax....and state on top it it if that applies if you sell.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-10-17.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",intraalpha,43,0.9,1.0,2025-10-13 16:05:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/

Saw 2 major analysts upgrade NVDA with an Overperform rating and target price of $300/share??  I hold NVDY which would be impacted by a large NVDA drop. Maybe selling some of your NVDA stock to lock in those profits would be a good portfolio move.  Some peace of mind. If the remainder of your shares does go to $300, you are still participating with a nice, safe nest egg. Then if the AI bubble does burst, sell the remainder ASAP to salvage as much profit as possible. Or some variation of that strategy going forward.

nj9htl4,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Look there are a couple options.

There are some more recent papers that say that 100% equity portfolios aren’t inferior to a more stock or bond portfolio as long as you’re at at 4% withdrawal rate. 

That being said I agree with you on the tech bubble. I don’t know when but we are probably gonna have a pop sometime and it will probably come with a pretty big market drop and probably a recession. Crashed early in a retirement portfolio life cycle are extra bad compared to later ones.

You didn’t mention in the context of your overall retirement savings what % nvidia is, but it still makes up 7.5% of the sp500 just by itself… so if you are all in on voo 7% of your worth is nvidia. What is your TOTAL exposure to nvidia: personal stocks +7% of sp500 holdings. If it’s more than 20% is definitely trim back to at least that number.

I personally am selling my nvidia this week as well. Partly bc of bubble fears though the other thing concerning me is we’re starting to see a rising number of vendor financing deals between different ai companies and nvidia is part of several of them. Any stumble from any part of the chain will make the whole pyramid collapse even worse than before. To me it’s enough of a shock to my thesis I think I’m going to take my profits. But that’s just me. 

I haven’t seen apple as involved in many of these deals but same logic as far as portfolio % applies.

As far as tax implications that’s a better question for an accountant, but typically you want to sell from tax advantaged accounts first and brokerages last. But that being said, I wouldn’t let the tax tail wag the dog on making smart decisions, jsut make sure you earmark some do the profits for taxes 

Also remeber it’s not all or nothing, you could for example sell 1/2, or 10% a month for thr next 12 months or whatever .

As far as safer places to go I think TIPS bonds are about as safe as it gets if a bit boring. If you want to stay in equities brk b is about as safe as it gets. It might still fall in a bubble but it shouldn’t be as far.",ninjagorilla,9,,,2025-10-13 14:44:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/nj9htl4/

I’m more worried than he is about locking in some gains. He doesn’t actively manage my personal portfolio, but will give general advice. I  own my house, don’t have much debt, and we live on about 5-6k a month, averaged out with paying school and property taxes, insurance, etc. I talked to a bunch of 1% AUM guys before I settled on him. He seems to be honest and also flat fee, so I felt comfortable with him.

1o57juv,post,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Is the most important selling point of bitcoin actually meaningless?,"""There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin"". This seems to be the main selling point in a world where governments regularly debase their currencies. However after doing some digging most people who think they ""own"" bitcoin don't actually self custody bitcoin. According to google's AI tool around 85 percent of people who buy bitcoin use a third party custodian. As far as I am aware there is no law that says these third parties must possess 100% of every bitcoin on their own books on behalf of their clients. Hell, as we all know, there is no law that says financial companies must possess 100% of the dollars we all deposit with them (see fractional reserve banking) so why would the government care if they hold the bitcoin on their books unencumbered by other claimants/owners. 

With that being said, the 21 million figure is meaningless if everyone looking at a number of Bitcoin on their computer screen does not actually represent the number of bitcoin they own. The same is true for other assets like stocks, gold, etc...  If you have an account with shares of GLD, you don't actually own gold bars in some vault. There are likely far more claims on gold than physical gold that has ever been mined. The same seems to be the case with Bitcoin, so saying there are ""only"" 21 million bitcoin does not matter if the supply in the marketplace is infinite via third party custodians.",warrenfgerald,521,0.84,735.0,2025-10-13 04:15:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/
1o56ghf,post,stocks,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Sofi's Private Market Funds,"As a shareholder I'm bullish on Sofi's long term outlook in their core business.

BUT I'm skeptical of the private investment funds which they offer. As a retail investor with ~$50k of dry powder, it seems better to just stick with ""boring"" old ETFs and other publicly traded assets. 

What incentive is there to invest a portion of that into any of the funds with $500 minimums such as the Cashmere fund or ARK Venture fund when I'll have to contend with high fees and illiquidity? 

Even the Private Shares Fund with its 2500 investment minimum seems like too low of a barrier to entry to warrant access to any of the best deals.  

Say my motivation to invest in these funds was because of specific companies (i.e. SpaceX with Ark Venture). Wouldn't there just be other, less friction ways of doing so? Investing in Google for instance, which owns a portion of SpaceX, to achieve that same exposure.  

The overwhelming feeling that I'm getting is that retail is the bag holder for PE/VC. Even if the amount of cash I had to invest was to 10x or 100x I'm fairly certain that statement would still ring true. Anyone have any thoughts on this?  

As a shareholder, I'm glad the option to invest is on the platform for other reasons, but count me out of them.

The hard part is the refinement infrastructure (huge investment with low margin return for years), and it took China approximately 20 years to build up the infrastructure to where they are today.  
  
So no, the EU + US are years, if not decades, behind in REE refinement. Our greedy govt + corporations screwed over the US' REE independence due to sheer myopic drive for margin.
  
Comments about REE consumption reduction is literally unfeasible. Each F-35 has 900lbs of REE. 900lbs ! And that's just F35.   
  
How about Tomahawks or the new Virginia-class subs? Military drones (UAV) all of them use high-end neodymium magnet motors that's all REE. Of course, if we allocate all the REE to military, then we can forget things like EV, indutrial robots, civilian drones, medical equipment, etc.

1o4waq2,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,$CRSR Corsair Gaming Analysis,"This was another bad year for the stock. Early 2025, the founder Andy Paul retired as CEO just before new tariffs hit. Stock fell to book value in April. Since then, the company revealed that tariff impacts were far less severe than feared. Less than 19% of revenue is from China-sourced products and PC components are exempt from tariffs now. The new CEO began executing a sharper, more innovation-led strategy that could turn the course.

Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Technology Conference the CEO revealed her vision: a company that’s not just riding hardware cycles but actively building an ecosystem that can transcend them. Her focus on accelerating product cadence, deepening integration across product segments, and unlocking new markets (like simulation hardware) seems to be working.

![img](by8kz7z4zmuf1)

Corsair operates in two main segments: Gamer/Creator Peripherals and Gaming Components/Systems. These products are commodity-like, but they are increasingly being tied together through Corsair’s blend of this hardware with their software, iCUE (soon to be replaced by Web Hub, more on this later). It provides seamless integration across a wide range of Corsair and third-party products. It allows users to control lighting, fan speeds, monitor system health, and stream overlays from a unified interface.

This increasingly software-enabled hardware ecosystem creates real switching costs. As customers invest in multiple Corsair and non-Corsair devices that are integrated via iCUE, they become locked in by the convenience and performance of the integrated hardware-software experience. In a space where hardware alone is rarely differentiated, software-driven cohesion could become Corsair’s moat.

Corsair had low margins, limited pricing power, and a lack of defensible moat. On top of this, PC and gaming hardware are exposed to cyclical volatility. But that is the Corsair of yesterday.

While stock-based compensation and amortization from acquisitions continued to weigh on GAAP profitability, free cash flow and revenue have improved significantly year-over-year. Net income remains volatile, but importantly, Corsair is beginning to generate investable profits from its higher-growth business lines, which management has said will be reinvested to develop high-margin, differentiated products. Furthermore, intangible losses and increased free cash flow have turned more of the company’s book-value into cash. That means firmer footing for its stock.

Q2 2025 and Ecosystem Expansion

Q2 2025 marked a critical turning point. Revenue benefited from strong product launches by NVIDIA and AMD, signaling the beginning of a new PC gaming upgrade cycle. This should be bigger and longer than before, because there is additional demand from Local Large Language Model enthusiasts who build PCs for AI purposes. Corsair’s performance closely tracks these third-party cycles, which is risky when you have no moat and low margins. Regardless, the company executed well in Q2.

The memory segment saw double-digit growth, although intense competition kept margins in check. Fortunately, Corsair’s scale helped it retain some leverage over suppliers, especially in a weak pricing environment.

Peripherals, Corsair’s most strategically important segment, grew 9% YoY. This might seem modest, but Corsair captured share in keyboards and headsets, and began rolling out its Fanatec racing rig, a turnkey experience that’s difficult for competitors to replicate quickly.

Importantly, growth in this segment isn’t hostage to supplier pricing power. With Elgato positioned to benefit from the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 launch and possibly even TikTok Live's surging popularity, this part of the business could become a key driver in upcoming quarters.

At the end of Q2, Corsair launched Corsair Web Hub to replace their troubled iCUE configuration software. The new web browser based system eliminates all of the problems iCUE had with software updates, boot compatibility, and cross-program interference. A major pain point for customers, this issue alone impacted brand loyalty and customer retention for years.

I've never had a problem with iCUE, but a lot of gamers have complex boot and update settings, or use MacOS. Now it is neatly contained in the web browser. Older products will be on-boarded to the Web Hub and increase customer satisfaction immediately. Such dramatic improvement in their core strategic asset accelerates Corsair’s path to become a hardware-software ecosystem.

Corsair currently upsells Elgato customers a Pro-version of the Elgato Stream Deck app and the Elgato Marketplace allow purchases and trading of digital gadgets that enhance Elgato hardware. This model could be brought to the iCUE or Web Hub experience, as the company releases more software-enriched products at a higher cadence. It would add a recurring, SAAS revenue stream layer across all of Corsair’s physical products.

The most exciting product launch just happened quietly at the end of August. Corsair launched the XENEON EDGE 14.5"" LCD Touchscreen. Initially met with skepticism, it sold out within 10 hours.

Priced at $250, this device appears to carry healthy margins and, crucially, faces no direct competition yet. This launch may be the first proof point in the CEO’s promise to deliver more frequent, innovative, high-quality products. If Corsair can maintain this pace of innovation, it could significantly alter how the market views the company’s long-term potential.

They also released a curved glass case that has iCUE-enabled fans included. Normally the fans were sold separately so gamers would opt for non-iCUE fans. As they tie more products together like this, it'll help strengthen the ecosystem.

Corsair’s acquisition of Fanatec is already paying dividends. The CEO has outlined a bold vision to expand beyond racing simulation into higher-margin simulation verticals such as golf, where hardware and software can deliver immersive experiences.

NVIDIA and AMD GPUs can now run Large Language Models locally (without the nanny restrictions of cloud based LLMs). Check r/LocalLLaMA to gauge the interest there. DDR memory prices have surged significantly in Q3, as consumer demand for Local Large Language Model-enabled PCs takes off. 

Since this surge is driven by consumer demand (not supply constraints on PC ram memory) Corsair stands to benefit from this surge. Furthermore, since this surge is likely to produce actual utility for the consumers experimenting with this technology, it could broaden further and shift the secular demand trend to benefit Corsair for several years.

Typically, memory cycles don't favor Corsair margins much. However, during COVID, the cycle was driven by consumer demand and Corsair had great margins in that cycle. This cycle is also shaping up to be that way with the addition of the Local LLM trend. If you combine these tailwinds in gaming hardware with long-awaited game launches, and Local LLMs the company is well-positioned to benefit from overlapping cycles.

B. Riley recently took the stock down by erroneously declaring 2026 as a console year, meaning customers would focus budgets on consoles instead of PCs. There are no major console releases expected in 2026. Also, consoles in general have tariffs whereas PC components are exempt. The new CEO's strategy is working and secular demand continues to rise. 

Despite past concerns around margins and moat, the company’s recent cash flow efficiency and clear strategic direction suggest that its potential as a hardware-software ecosystem leader for gamers and creators is underpriced.",moazzam0,0,0.5,22.0,2025-10-12 20:13:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4waq2/crsr_corsair_gaming_analysis/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4waq2/crsr_corsair_gaming_analysis/

1o4ufmv,post,stocks,SU.PA,Schneider Electric SE,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?

I get it.

Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?

Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?

Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.

But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.

First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.

Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.

Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.

I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.

Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.

""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""

AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.""

Who am I to argue with Su, who may go down as one of the best tech CEOs of all time? What she has done at AMD since joining in 2012 is mind-blowing.

Lastly, let's talk about AI worrywarts' warning calls about valuations.

According to new research out of Goldman Sachs this week, the median forward P/E ratio across the ""Magnificent Seven"" is 27 times, or 26 times if excluding Tesla (TSLA), which has a much higher multiple than the other companies. This is roughly half the equivalent valuation of the biggest seven companies in the late 1990s, and the dominant companies in Japan (mostly banks) traded at higher valuations still.

What's more, the current enterprise-to-sales ratios are also much lower than those of the dominant companies in the late 1990s.

""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" said Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

I couldn't agree more, Peter.",TylerDurdenEsq,173,0.76,181.0,2025-10-12 19:02:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/

Private credit bros and banks got roasted Jefferies, UBS linked funds, BlackRock and others named as creditors and staring at billions of potential losses.


Debt was both on the books and hidden off the books in invoice finance traps; lenders later found the same invoices pledged to multiple parties.

Court filings say up to $2.3B vanished and the company had under $30M cash when it folded.


Private credit’s lack of transparency turned this from a corporate bankruptcy into a Wall Street embarrassment.




Enter AI: 

Anthropic and OpenAI sit private and thirsty for capital, able to sip the same private-credit punch that fueled First Brands, insulating them from public scrutiny while amplifying leverage flowing into the AI hype cycle.


Nvidia sits at the center of the loop chips fuel models, PE/private-credit fuels models, and model winners feed back into Nvidia demand; the result is a circular money flow where ever-higher GPU bets are collateral for more private credit.


If private credit rehypothecation and invoice-style double counting are anywhere near systemic, the unwind could cascade: credit freezes, asset fire sales, AI valuations collapsing, Nvidia multiples re-rating, and a market liquidity spiral.

The stock market continued to rise slowly while the government remaining closed. We did not see any labor market data, so the stock market could not get information from reports. The S&P 500 dropped more than 2.5% in a single day, but volume was only slightly above 20-day moving average. The stock market had made all-time high after another. I believe that we don't need to make any panic yet. We've seen this before.

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

nj3xm3w,comment,france,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Les Français n'ont pas accès au même Google que les utilisateurs du reste du monde.,"> Si la France fait figure d'exception, ce n'est pas par choix technologique, mais bien à cause d'un épineux blocage réglementaire centré sur les droits voisins de la presse. Ces droits visent à rémunérer les éditeurs de sites web et les agences de presse lorsque leurs contenus sont réutilisés par les plateformes en ligne

Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas le sujet, il faut savoir que Google donne des millions par an aux sociétés de presse pour avoir le droit de reprendre les liens des articles de journaux sur Google Actualités (et sans doute ailleurs aussi). C'est le résultat d'un lobbying du monde de la presse qui disait ""c'est injuste que Google se fasse de l'argent grâce à nous"" (mais qui était quand même bien content que Google leur apporte du trafic, cf. les cris d'orfraie quand Google [a commencé à désindexer des journaux](https://next.ink/6606/108234-pourquoi-google-ne-paiera-pas-droits-voisins-editeurs-et-agences-presse/)) et qui a réussi à convaincre le législateur français de mettre en place une taxe.

Taxe qui n'a absolument aucun sens : c'est comme si Vinci Autoroutes devait donner de l'argent à un centre commercial, car Vinci gagne de l'argent avec les péages qui mènent au centre commercial. Sauf qu'il y a aussi les départementales et les nationales (gratuites) pour aller au centre commercial, et même si les autoroutes sont payantes, elles apportent aussi un grand nombre de clients...

Du coup, quand on voit la couleuvre que la France a réussi à faire avaler à Google, pas étonnant qu'ils n'ont pas trop envie de se frotter à ça.

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop. 

Just an example : EU can't find Germanium for their defense sector

>

Perso, pour deux raisons :

1. La gestion des onglets lorsqu'il y en a de nombreux d'ouverts. Firefox cache les premiers. De plus, leur taille minimale est beaucoup plus élevée que sur Chrome, ce qui fait qu'on ne peut pas en ouvrir autant que sur les navigateurs de type chromium avant que cet antipattern de masquage d'onglets ne se déclenche. De mémoire, ça se règle dans les paramètres, mais on ne peut pas descendre plus bas qu'à peu près du double de la taille minimale des onglets sur Chrome.

2. Il faut migrer toutes les extensions qui rendent un navigateur à peu près commode à utiliser, ce qui est pas forcément possible. Il faut aussi migrer les scripts Tampermonkey, et, pour cela, il faut du temps et des compétences qu'on a pas/plus forcément.

Franchement et sans déconner, j'ai plus de mal à passer de Chromium à Firefox que je n'en ai eu de passer de W10 à Linux Mint.",TrueRignak,-10,,,2025-10-12 13:26:36,https://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/2035525/les-francais-n-ont-pas-acces-au-meme-google-que-les-utilisateurs-du-reste-du-monde.htm,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o4kqul/les_français_nont_pas_accès_au_même_google_que/nj34rz7/

nj2eo5d,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Buy NVDA or NBIS?,"I think $NVDA has a great chance of 3x by 2030, which would land it around $15 market cap.  That is lower than the 10x you are looking for.  However a 3x would be sizable especially considering the nature of the underlying asset.  While that seems like an extreme market cap, more and more sectors of the economy are being revolutionized by AI.  Medical records are now written by AI.  Financial investment apps have AI assistants now to help investors make trading and long term financial decisions.  And this is just the web based AI. Once AI brains are placed in robots, even more of the economy becomes dependent on chips, which all leads back to Nvidia.  With $NVDA too, its dividend will grow over time making holding it in your portfolio even more profitable over long periods of time. Right now the dividend isn’t much, but the dividend growth rate should mean that the dividend increases over time to amplify returns from $NVDA.  $NBIS does not currently have a dividend, though this could change as it becomes highly profitable.

$NBIS is a good bet for a longer term timescale, more like 10 years to 10x due to the time it will take to generate profits with high capex costs up front.

NBIS buys GPUs to rent out, it's the type of business with no moat, similar to crypto mining. Anybody who can run electricity into a shack and hook up some server racks can get started and offer the exact same service. Like crypto mining this can be extremely profitable in a boom, during the crypto boom in 2018 a $400 GPU could earn $8 a day, that's 100% in profit every 50 days, so when timed well the earnings can be explosive. But when market conditions normalize margins will be razor thin.

nj0vx4z,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,What do you think are the best plays for overreactions to the tariff news?,"Bro you do not need to be fukn with options. Shares. Shares. SHARES. You are probably not gonna lose 100% of your shares. That's an important distinction. And I've done it, with massive amounts of money...even now lol. But I made big swings too. And I have an unhealthy level of risk tolerance probably. Not just here. I've lost over 100k in options premiums this year. And slept fine on those bad days. I'm just saying I know it's statistically improbable that you have that same temperament. And not sleeping well after that leads to more bad decisions, health issues, redheads, horrifying things.

And still the best decision I ever made was 2300 bucks in 2017. And I held those shares through every sell off. I looked at the argument to sell, and the argument to hold, not the non-specific soundbites about time in the market. I picked what seemed like the stronger argument. That eventually became 600 some odd shares of NVDA. and I had more, but that was the 2300 bucks. 

If you have a high conviction play or two, invest there, and watch. Just watch how it responds to events, news, earnings, rate cuts, oil shortages, war, etc. Listen to the calls. Did they lie? Are they  actually part of the con? Diluting your shares annually? 

When you see an acronym you don't understand, that's what you're doing today. Now, not later. Then...you will be smarter and you'll intuitively know that stock's movements. You're golden.

Options you can be 100% right and lose it all. That is a F'd up risk/reward ratio. And it's bait to have you blow up your account, say the line everyone says, buy an etf and let them put it where they want. By the way, I did that for years too. And especially when reinvesting dividends, yeah, great call. I'm smarter now and trying some other things. But I'm only doing LEAPS, puts, or selling options. 95% will be shares. At the end of the day it's still picking good companies, and smelling the horseshit before you step in it.",SdrawkcabEmaN2,3,,,2025-10-12 02:05:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o40qeq/what_do_you_think_are_the_best_plays_for/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o40qeq/what_do_you_think_are_the_best_plays_for/nj0vx4z/

niz0azx,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,What do you think are the best plays for overreactions to the tariff news?,"3x LETFs how I'm playing them. Buy them at the bottom and profit on TACO without need for leverage which could cause a margin call. TQQQ and SOXL my focus vs bothering with individual stocks such as NVDA or AVGO or AMD or their 2x derivatives. Much easier following a sector then stocks. All traded on cash which means I can exit quickly and just simply buy back in acquiring more shares with same capital waiting on the reversal.

I feel like timing is EVERYTHING with Google. Most stocks, you can be patient and you'll be properly rewarded (assuming you picked a good stock). With Google, it will normally hit it's highest share price in the afterhours right after earnings, and then it won't touch that mark again for months it seems like. So, if you want to try to sell Google at the tippity top, you need to sell in the afterhours right after a good earnings report, because the next market day, it's going to be lower than those highs, like 9 times out of 10.

It's like Google will get it's share of ""pops"", but they're very, very short lived.

1o3ysmi,post,stocks,TSLA,Tesla Inc.,Tesla’s Balancing Act Between Growth and Pressure,"Tesla’s current position in the electric vehicle market shows a mix of strength and strain. The company continues to post record delivery numbers, yet its financials hint at underlying pressure. In FY 2025 Q2, Tesla’s revenue growth declined by 2.73%, and EPS dropped sharply by 53.55%, signaling that profitability remains a concern even with a strong 165.10% rise in free cash flow. These numbers suggest that while Tesla’s core operations are still generating cash, its margins are feeling the impact of competition and pricing adjustments.

Analyst sentiment around Tesla remains divided. Wedbush maintains a bullish view with a $600 target, while Morgan Stanley remains more conservative at $410. The current price of $413.49 places the stock right in the middle of those expectations, reflecting both investor optimism and caution. When I checked the market earlier through bitget onchain, the general sentiment across assets still looked uncertain, and that same tone seems to mirror Tesla’s current setup. The range of price targets, from as low as $276 to as high as $600, shows how differently the market is reading Tesla’s future growth story.

Meanwhile, insider confidence appears strong. Elon Musk recently made 25 purchase transactions worth nearly $1 billion, acquiring just over three million shares on September 12, 2025. These unusually large purchases might be seen as a signal of long-term belief in the company’s direction, even as Tesla faces rising competition in China from BYD, Nio, and other local brands. With gross margins now at 17.48% and operating margins slipping to 6.06%, the next few quarters will show whether Tesla can sustain its leadership while navigating a tighter, more competitive EV market.",Naive_Chipmunk_3850,0,0.13,5.0,2025-10-11 17:40:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3ysmi/teslas_balancing_act_between_growth_and_pressure/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3ysmi/teslas_balancing_act_between_growth_and_pressure/

nixkgrj,comment,europe,SAN.PA,Sanofi SA,"A statue of Fido is unveiled in Borgo San Lorenzo, Tuscany, in 1957. Fido was an English Pointer mutt who waited every day for 14 years the bus his dead owner took to get to work.","Fido (1941 – June 9, 1958) was an Italian dog that came to public attention in 1943 because of his demonstration of unwavering loyalty to his dead master. Fido was the subject of articles appearing in many Italian and international magazines and newspapers, was featured in newsreels throughout Italy, and was bestowed several honors, including a public statue erected in his honor.

Fido probably began life sometime in the autumn of 1941 as an independent street dog in Luco di Mugello, a small town in the municipality of Borgo San Lorenzo, in the Tuscan Province of Florence, Italy. One night in November 1941, a brick kiln worker in Borgo San Lorenzo named Carlo Soriani, on his way home from the bus stop, found the dog lying injured in a roadside ditch. Not knowing whom the dog belonged to, Soriani took him home and nursed him back to health. Soriani and his wife decided to adopt the dog, naming him Fido (""faithful"", from Latin fidus).

After Fido recovered, he followed Soriani to the bus stop in the central square of Luco di Mugello and watched him board the bus for his job. When the bus returned in the evening, Fido greeted Soriani and followed him home. This pattern repeated every workday for two years.

On December 30, 1943, Borgo San Lorenzo was bombed by the Allies during the Second World War, and Soriani was killed. That evening, Fido showed up as usual at the bus stop, but did not see Soriani disembark. Fido later returned home, but for fourteen years thereafter (more than 5,000 times), until the day of his death, he went daily to the stop, waiting for Soriani to get off the bus.

Public interest in Fido grew during his life. Italian magazines Gente and Grand Hotel published the story of the dog, which also appeared in several newsreels of the Istituto Luce. Many readers were struck by the extraordinary faithfulness of Fido, including the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo, who, on November 9, 1957, awarded him a gold medal in the presence of many citizens including Soriani's moved widow. Time magazine wrote an article about Fido in April 1957.

Fido died still waiting for his master on 9 June 1958. The news of his death was announced to the public by the newspaper on a four-column front-page story in La Nazione. Fido was buried outside the cemetery of Luco di Mugello beside his master, Carlo Soriani.

At the end of 1957, when Fido was still alive, the Comune of Borgo San Lorenzo commissioned the sculptor Salvatore Cipolla to create a monument of the dog as a testimony of that exemplary story of love and fidelity. The work, entitled ""Monument to the dog Fido"", was placed in Piazza Dante in Borgo San Lorenzo, next to the municipal palace. Under the statue depicting the dog is the dedication: A FIDO, ESEMPIO DI FEDELTÀ (TO FIDO, EXAMPLE OF LOYALTY). The monument was inaugurated by the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo, in the presence of Fido and Soriani's widow. Originally, the statue was realized in majolica, but a few months after the inauguration some vandals destroyed it.

1o3pih8,post,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Investing in my early twenties,"Hi, I'm 20 years old and currently a student. I've been investing for a while now, so far I've invested around $35,000. Most of my portfolio is in domestic stocks from my country, but recently I’ve started allocating a larger portion to international stocks like Nvidia, AMD, SoFi, the S&P 500, and so on. I also have a part of my portfolio in Bitcoin.
I plan to invest around $350 every month. Do you think that's too small of an amount?
Since I’m investing regularly and with a long-term perspective, is it important to actively follow stock prices and try to buy only during dips, or does that not really matter in the long run?
Do you think the amount I've already invested, combined with the $350 I plan to add monthly, could grow into something meaningful over the next 10 to 15 years or are these amounts too small?
Also, is Bitcoin a smart investment in general ? Considering my age and higher risk tolerance.

1o3p120,post,stocks,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti,"$LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security & IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives. It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \~1,500× & 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power & a Wix website. 

SEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness & a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, & branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” & “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 & reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products & the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month & carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards & a rotation of partnerships & acquisitions.  
  
When the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence. Quantum computing demands a level of obsessive attention to detail: fractions of a Kelvin, picosecond timing, noise isolation at the edge of physics. When the front end looks half-finished, it’s hard not to question whether that discipline extends behind the lab door. Something doesn’t add up. Have you seen SEALSQ’s website? If corporate websites are any proxy for DNA, SEALSQ looks like it’s building things that actually work.   
  
Expect a fresh wave of press releases & conveniently timed analyst upgrades in the near term. The Quantum + AI Conference: alternately marketed as Quantum + AI 2.0 or IQT Quantum + AI, depending on who’s paying for the banner, will occur October 19–21, 2025, in New York City. The agenda promises deep inquiry into the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, & cryptographic security. Attendees can expect the full liturgy: keynotes, panels, mentoring sessions, & exhibitions. Organized in part by Inside Quantum Technology (IQT), the event serves as yet another congregation of researchers, investors, & professional futurists between funding rounds. $LAES SEALSQ headlines with the highest tier of logo placement. Amazon AWS, Nvidia, IonQ, Rigetti, Salesforce, Amgen, CNN, & Cantor Fitzgerald will also attend.

1o3on07,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,NVDA to the moon,"A lot of people have been talking about how NVDA is going to hit a wall and decline with respect to revenue from new installs but I'm here to say why that argument is wrong.

They're saying its like the fiber companies of the dot com era.

But for two reasons it's not. 1. not ""dark fibre"" comparison. The chips are fully utilized. 2. The difference in useful life. A GPU rack is 4-6 years, fibre optic cable is 25-40 years.

This idea started when I was listening to this podcast today [https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626) where at about the 1hr mark they're talking about the CAPEX/OPEX of data centres.

Someone points out and Chamath agrees that the chip failure rate is between 9%-20% in these GPU racks which is insanely high! I also think I remember Dylan Patel saying something similar on a a16z episode.

From those two data points alone [I](https://pocket-quant.com/dashboard?share=0199d1fe-157a-7383-b4bd-45b8fba4e38d) extrapolated that NVDA might be sitting on somewhere between $27B per year and $60B/year in basically recurring revenues from the need to replace failed racks

Once you add in a 4-6 year replacement cadence for the rest of the chips you're looking at anywhere from $90 BILLION to $140 BILLION a year in recurring revenue from scheduled replacements and failures. This is not including future buildout.

  
This isn't just going to act as a floor to their revenues for years if not decades to come. It is their ENTIRE current revenue. They're looking at a massive and durable business just like INTC, hopefully they don't drop the bag like INTC once they're in pole position.

Also according to this deep research report the average chip cycle is 10 years long and we're in year 3ish [https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143](https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143)

Hood has been a monster. I personally think Vlad is executing at a high level and will be one of the biggest winners in fintech over time (why I’m still holding shares there). Webull is a smaller fish making their way around the pond right now. I don’t know many folks who use them, but I assume they’re out there. They’ve seen 46% YoY revenue growth, have 1.6 billion in cash, solid growth in assets under custody, international growth prospects, new product line potentials, and are now sitting at just a $5b MC. 

It is not overly valued compared to many other high flyers right now that are still up multiple baggers YTD even with this pullback. Maybe it trades down to the $9-10 range with increased market weakness but I’m feeling very comfortable at these levels for a longer term bet on this being a big outperformer in the near future.

1o3ewij,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI,"Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned.

Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.

The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.

Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.

Xiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.

Investors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.

Prompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.

Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.

Silicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple’s deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company’s founder and other execs, and Google’s $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf’s CEO and leaders that included licensing fees.

Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple’s biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines.

Some analysts have attributed Apple’s relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps.

While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker’s foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users.

Prompt’s technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple’s HomeKit smart home division.

niuig9x,comment,wallstreetbets,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","Ok I didn't read the post but I get the gist,  op and family blootered a fortune into reddit. 
Nobody asked for my opinion so here it is;


I like reddit and I spend too much time on it, and I try to convince my friends to do the same.  Someone asked me why I liked reddit and I told them it's the only social media that doesn't make me want to smash my phone up.  Now you could argue that it's not a true social media,  whatever,  but I can't stand FB, insta, xitter,  YouTube,  I only use them when I can't avoid it.  But I can happily spend hours every day on reddit.  


Mainly be cause I'm not getting fed Conservative propaganda here but I do feel that they are reluctantly getting with the mango programme.  When I started a new account I was being fed a steady diet of right wing rage bait 


I understand that big businesses have to compromise to stay in business in the current climate but if reddit loses its usp as the only kinda independent big social platform then it has to fall back on the hobbyist,  forum type users.  And that's not big advertising money, I'd Say .


The bots  are getting out of hand,  not necessarily intrusive,  just clogging up the conversation with inane jokey meme comments.  When a big news story breaks I can read about it in maybe 5 front page type subs,  and it's the same endless joke chains,  when I want to read real discussion and opinion.  I can't honestly believe that's real people taking the time to type lazy one liners thousands of times a day. 


And the censorship is getting worse.  If reddit is so scared to upset the snowflake Conservative ruling class it's going to lose its remaining credibility.  


There is a place for reddit,  between the overly earnest and wholesome Liberal spaces and the right wing cesspits.  If it moves in either direction its gonna fail. ",Dear_Smoke6964,6,,,2025-10-11 00:00:42,https://i.redd.it/ydve6ozo1auf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/niuig9x/

‘Changing of the guard’ between the Italian Air Force aircrafts deployed as part of NATO's Enhanced Air Policing (EAP) mission, which contributes to the surveillance and defence of the Alliance's eastern flank.

The handover ceremony marked the end of the Task Group Lightning mission, which operated for two months in Estonia with F-35 aircrafts.

During the mission, over 150 sorties and 300 flight hours were carried out, with numerous interceptions of unidentified aircrafts.

This is the third time that the Italian Air Force has deployed personnel and equipment to Estonia and the second time that F-35s have participated in NATO's security mission in the Baltic, on the easternmost flank of the Atlantic Alliance.

The mission will continue with Eurofighters, maintaining its capabilities unchanged and confirming Italy's commitment to the collective security of the Atlantic Alliance.

With Operation Baltic Eagle III, the Italian Air Force is contributing to the protection of the airspace of the Baltic Republics as part of NATO's enhanced Air Policing mission, whose objective is to preserve allied airspace while ensuring the country's training needs are met.

The Air Task Force is redeployed at Ämari Airport, a few kilometres from Tallinn, and has deployed F-35A aircrafts from the 32nd Wing in Amendola and the 6th Wing in Ghedi, now replaced by Eurofighter Typhoon multi-role aircrafts from the 4th Wing in Grosseto, the 36th Wing in Gioia del Colle, the 37th Wing in Trapani and the 51st Wing in Istrana. The Task Force also deployed the Gulfstream G550 CAEW (Conformal Airborne Early Warning) aircraft from the 14th Wing for aerial surveillance, search and control tasks, and the SAMP/T missile system from the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Command in Sabaudia for protection against aerial threats.",TheCommentaryKing,8,,,2025-10-10 21:11:21,https://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/news/difesa-estonia-gli-eurofighter-subentrano-agli-f-35/,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o3a0t5/nato_baltic_air_policing_estonia_eurofighters/nitml4j/

Je suis une étudiante en Master psychologie et j'ai vu que certain de mes cours seraient très pratique à prendre avec une tablette. Mais je n'en ai pas. 

J'aimerais donc me prendre une tablette/ipad pour mes cours officiellement mais pas que bien évidemment. À côté j'aimerais pourvoir éditer des photos, faire du dessin (juste comme occupation tiers je ne suis pas Dali), regarde séries/films (classique), etc une utilisation polyvalente finalement. 

Mais je ne sais pas trop quoi prendre. Car je n'ai jamais eu d'appareil Apple mais je n'entends pas de positifs sur les appareils Android. (notamment au niveau des ram ou askip les Android sont très nuls contrairement aux Apple). Donc je pensais prendre un Ipad air car je peux m'envoyer les documents important par mail car c'est des fichiers pas très lourds ou utiliser une clé usb et cela ne me dérange pas.

Initialement je pensais partir sur un ipad air 5, mais au vu de l'année de sorti je me suis dis qu'un 6 serait peut être préférable. Voir le 7 si les prix en reconditionné ne sont pas trop loin. 

Mais est ce vraiment un bon choix ?

I've been exploring investing in stocks and/or ETFs for a while now. I just don't know how much of my money I should allocate for that.

What's your advice? I could invest almost anything, since I'm probably not moving out for a few years and will hardly spend my money until then. But of course, I need to have some money left over for when I'm no longer living at home.

Worth mentioning that Google also invested a lot into Anthropic and has a stake, maybe even larger than Amazon's. It's still mostly private information.

We've been using ML for this purpose for a long time already.

LLMs might simplify the process of diagnosis or creating treatment plans, but that's an efficiency improvement, not a cure. 

As for Nvidia, it's easy to get lucky, because whether it's ML, or LLMs, or Crypto the compute cores they provide are the ""picks and shovels"" play of this gold rush.

nis69gt,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Selling my 458 shares of Apple in 2020 probably my biggest investing regret,"Okay but Apple is up 118% and the S and p is up 95% over the last 5 years.

So even if you sold apple and then just bought the broader market you lost some returns but are still way up and you sacrificed risk (concentration in Apple stock) with diversification. Unsurprisingly, sometimes safer, more diversified investments can come with modestly lower gains.

So frankly, unless you sold apple and just gambled on crypto meme stocks or other individual stocks that trailed the market, you made a perfectly good investment decision with only a modestly lower rate of return. 

So I would argue this is unlikely to have been even close to the worst financial decision you have made in your life, and if you’re beating yourself up over it then I think you learned the wrong lesson about investing.

This is like when people say “I should have bought Bitcoin when it was valued at $20”. That was my worst financial decision ever! 

If you knew the future then, yes, this would have been a bad decision. But not knowing the future means that decisions are made with uncertainty and whether it is a good or bad financial decision cannot be judged based upon unpredictable future outcomes.",pseudomoniae,1,,,2025-10-10 16:53:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2jrqm/selling_my_458_shares_of_apple_in_2020_probably/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2jrqm/selling_my_458_shares_of_apple_in_2020_probably/nis69gt/
1o32ro4,post,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,AI is Not In A Bubble or Is It?,"I was in the comments to a post about something completely different and inadvertently started a debate on this topic (LOL), so wanted to start its own discussion thread because this is an important topic with lots of viewpoints.  I anticipate/hope we will get the statistics folks to reformulate the current market ratios and create new ones and tell us which ones are important and which ones aren’t and we’ll have at least 3 people who redefine the term ‘Bubble’ so that the answers will be a lot more nuanced then yes or no. We should welcome all of that and get everyone’s views because in the end, NONE of us will be completely correct!

My take, we have too many young traders who treat the stock market like a casino. For that reason, uneducated sentiment has the capacity to drive dips and swells and volatility which we might call a ‘Bubble’ when too many gamblers are riding a group of stocks or indexes simply because they think they can time the market and market sentiment.  But AI will escape the Bubble fate in the bear term because while it may be more expensive then past market leaders, it is not illogically priced and the opportunity to own a piece of the current technology is like the opportunity to own copper before electricity or oil before automobiles.  And a key difference is that it is mostly intangible “Intellectual Property” that is owned and unlike a physical commodity, it can be leveraged an infinite amount of ways, so the earnings capacity of a single piece of AI code has almost limitless earnings capacity.  The only limitation is the ability of the owner to build sufficient infrastructure to put it to work. 

Think about a new drug that cures every kind of cancer. Now imagine that we ALL have cancer. The stock of pharmaceutical companies can go up thousands of percent overnight if you are there on the day that the breakthrough is discovered.  That’s how you have to think about AI, but it’s nit just curing cancer (and it WILL do that), it’s curing every illness and disease known and unknown, it is automating everything, it will simplify attainment and use of logic and knowledge in all aspects of our lives. As the hardware becomes better and more efficient and everything is using it and it is all tied together, it will be even more efficient and effective. 

So, you’re paying 40x earnings?  In the next 5-10 years earnings will be 1000x what they are today for a company like NVIDIA. Ownership is almost priceless, there’s no “Bubble”, they’ve discovered the cure for cancer and everything else; if it were a pharmaceutical company, the stock would have been up 10,000x by now.

1o2zf8d,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","**TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:
   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.*
* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:
   * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.*
   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*. OpenAI doesn't want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with* [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-google-search-trial-774f4774?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi2Aepz4YfkUzHlyW43XKFw5jYgLonf0RqC-XMCO1XblHovzKcMOxODMv7rkOY%3D&gaa_ts=68e8ec3f&gaa_sig=aoxKHEAywLIAKYAhJQLXOxevRchLEJ2gA5pO3e7p5VMHy7uJWtgMMSjRJ6U0IHEz5ppiUJPdvwSLlSbFSJdOUQ%3D%3D)*.*
   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

1o2xukt,post,investing,MC.PA,LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE,Opinions on investment mix for newly retired.,"Trying this again since my previous post was too fund-specific. Retired a little under three years ago, and was hoping to get some (constructive) opinions on my current account diversification. I am of the opinion that the market is due for a sizable correction that will lead to a stagflation scenario. To that end I diversified seven months ago into a “first step” mix that I think will, with further adjustments, stand up in that future scenario. I have one year’s worth of expenses in a HYSA separately. I pull mainly from Roth contributions and 457b currently. The percentages are a bit wonky; I haven’t rebalanced yet. Can I get your take on it’s current state?

Top Level: 84% Equity, 8% Bonds, 5% Cash, 3% Gold

ROTH: 82% Equity, 12% Bonds, 6% Gold. 60% Domestic, 20% Int’l, 20% Global. 63% LC, 2% MC, 10% SC, 7% EM, 12% Fixed, 6% Other. 71% Blend, 5% Value, 6% Growth, 12% Bond, 6% Other. Bonds 58% Mixed, 42% Treasury

IRA: 77% Equity, 17% Bonds, 6% Gold. 72% Domestic, 22% Int’l, 6% Global. 60% LC, 5% MC, 6% SC, 6% EM, 17% Fixed, 6% Other. 53% Blend, 9% Value, 10% Sector, 5% Growth, 17% Bond, 6% Other. Bonds 65% Mixed, 35% Treasury

457b: 92% Equity, 8% Cash. 58% Domestic, 34% Int’l, 8% Other. 82% LC, 10% EM, 8% Other. 92% Blend, 8% Other.

**Long:**  
Chronicle history of that and why i conclude to it.

* Couple of month ago China started the blame game with ""**Is there some spyware or tracking your GPU Nvidia""**
* Then China started publically pushing companies to buy local GPU´s
* Then China´s Antitrust authority accuses Nvidia of violating merger conditions
* NVIDIA started saying they don´t consider any earnings or projections for China for the forseeable future at last quartly reports

**Result:** Either black market through Singapore or others are blooming and everybody looks away or china is truely not buying more. But both means status quo stays, revenue is either still 0 or still growing the same amount through black markets it has done before, smoothly calculated in all future projections.",mbreaddit,-1,,,2025-10-10 12:49:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2xerc/senate_passes_bill_limiting_nvidia_and_amd_ai/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2xerc/senate_passes_bill_limiting_nvidia_and_amd_ai/nir20es/

The deal makes Rocket Lab the primary launch provider to deploy iQPS' commercial Earth-imaging constellation.

The contract includes three missions for Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, which will launch no earlier than 2026 from the company's Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand.

Each is expected to deploy a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite from Rocket Lab's Motorized Lightband separation system. Rocket Lab says the missions will demonstrate its vertical integration across launch and space systems, which ""improves reliability and streamlines the launch process for customers.""

iQPS previously booked four Electron missions, bringing its total number of upcoming Rocket Lab launches to seven. The company successfully deployed four satellites with Rocket Lab already this year, iQPS CEO Dr. Shunsuke Onishi said.""

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

nioflbj,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"There are two complicating factors right now. One is there is very little institutional shorting. Shorting is necessary for accurate price discovery. The other is share repurchases. Or the degree of share repurchases.

Onto your question, share repurchases provide buoyancy. Apple for example paid out more in share repurchases last quarter than the the company earned. That is from memory maybe it was the previous quarter.

Share Repurchases also can happen off market so that if anyone wants to sell the company can just prevent that selling pressure. 

Without institutions shorting what you have is only retail shorting stocks and the company buying shares which forces a rolling retail short squeeze. This is why the entire market is up since 2020 essentially. Just a prolonged retail short squeeze. This is an over simplification. PODs and algo shops are learning the patterns and magnifying this effect. Option writers/market makers are also using the volatility as well.

Just remember, no one has to  a *buy a s*tock for it to go.

Just one person has to be caught short and need to cover. 

Until buybacks stop en mass, which retail won't hear about until it's too late.

""In addition, cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for employee stock option and purchase plans. The buyback program has not kept pace with employee stock option grants or exercises. Beginning in fiscal 1990, Microsoft has repurchased 710 million common shares while 1.79 billion shares were issued under the Company’s employee stock option and purchase plans. The market value of all outstanding stock options was $69 billion as of June 30, 1999. Microsoft enhances its repurchase program by selling put warrants. During December 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible exchangeable preferred stock. Net proceeds of $980 million were used to repurchase common shares. In December 1999, each preferred share is convertible into common shares or an equivalent amount of cash determined by a formula that provides a floor price of $79.875 and a cap of $102.24 per preferred share, equivalent to $19.97 and $25.56 per common share.""

From 1996-1999, they repurchased $980 million.

[https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar99/mdna.htm](https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar99/mdna.htm)

There was $1T in share repurchases last year.  As the free float decreases the affect of decreasing liquidity is not linear.  So buying back shares for the last decade has created an entirely different mechanic than in 1999.

With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

 

Notable:

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48
4 Companies from 1999 had a positive return through 2006. 
5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

Looking on some ideas/advice of where to invest in a joint account with my wife. 

Little Background. 

My wife has a 401k through her employer

I have a state pension and a Roth IRA that I invest heavily into VOO and I have a large chunk of NVDA, some Amazon, MSFT, and a little PEG.

My Wife and I are saving upwards of $4k every month and I want to take a chunk of that and invest in a joint account so our money works for us a little more.

Do I just invest in more VOO or do invest in a different ETF, go Dividend heavy, or something else all together? 

I feel like VOO would be ok but that doesn't give us much diversity in our portfolio. 

What would you do?

1o27ng5,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"Intel gives first look at next-gen chips, says Arizona fab is fully operational","Intel on Thursday announced its new PC chips slated to debut in laptops next year as the chipmaker battles to turn around its struggling business.

The company said the new Panther Lake processor is made with its 18A technology and is the most advanced node made on U.S. soil.

The new generation of chips will be made at Intel’s Fab 52 facility in Arizona, which the company said is now fully operational and set to ramp production.

“The United States has always been home to Intel’s most advanced R&D, product design and manufacturing – and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,” CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a release announcing the news.

Intel’s latest reveal comes during a critical stretch for the beleaguered chipmaker that has lagged in recent years and struggled to keep up with cutting-edge chip demands spurred by the artificial intelligence revolution.

In August, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in the company in an effort to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.

Since taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.

This summer, President Donald Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.

Intel shares have bounced 87% this year.
