njwj06k,comment,europe,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft forced to make Windows 10 extended security updates truly free in Europe,"Actually the oldest CPUs officially supported by Windows 11 are:

- Intel 8th Gen (Coffee Lake) — launched October 5, 2017 on a 14nm node

- AMD Ryzen 2000 series (Zen+) — launched April 19, 2018 on a 12nm node

That means by the time Windows 10 hits End of Life (October 14, 2025) those CPUs will already be 7–8 years old.

For context the average age of PCs in active use:

-  Corporate fleets: ~4–5 years

-  Consumer PCs: ~6–7 years

So we’re already at the point where a big chunk of the world’s active Windows 10 machines can’t upgrade to Windows 11 and these aren’t the r/PCMasterRace crowd with custom rigs and spare parts lying around. These are everyday users and small businesses keeping decade-old machines alive because they just work.

The people with that kind of skillset or interest to keep hardware running beyond 8–10 years are a tiny minority. For most folks their hardware lifecycle just doesn’t match Microsoft’s compatibility cutoff.",no1kn0wsm3,1,,,2025-10-17 04:09:54,https://www.theverge.com/news/785544/microsoft-windows-10-extended-security-updates-free-europe-changes,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nquogc/microsoft_forced_to_make_windows_10_extended/njwj06k/
1o8cw2k,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline (most people are focusing on interest rate cuts, but ignoring this fatal truth)","The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month, but Powell's statement last night is the real bombshell, signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction. Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.

Balance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults. When the Fed sells mortgage bonds, it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings. When it sells Treasury bonds, corporate bond issuance costs also rise. This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity, which requires closer scrutiny. History always repeats itself. On the eve of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn't stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero. Ultimately, it was the initiation of Q1, or reverse balance sheet reduction, that stabilized the financial system. In his speech yesterday, Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets. This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019, when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10%, nearly shutting down Wall Street. He's clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake, and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment. On the surface, the US stock market is still rising, but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants, which together account for over 32% of the S&P 500's weighting. The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium-sized businesses are struggling with financing costs. This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate, but the patient's hands and feet are already cold. Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy. Even more subversive, halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic. When the Fed expands its balance sheet again, it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar. This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash. He didn't rush to cut interest rates back then, but instead directly injected liquidity into the market, successfully stemming the spread of the crisis. Powell's approach is now precisely the same. For businesses, this is an even more life-or-death situation. The Treasury Department issues $1 trillion in bonds every quarter. If the Fed stops selling them, it effectively lowers the government's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, giants like Apple and Microsoft, with $800 billion in cash on hand, will be in for a rude awakening. Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash, and the money they hold is quietly evaporating. So, when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts, remember the deeper meaning behind Powell's move, as quoted by Dave Reifsner, Director of Research at the Federal Reserve.

A famous governance maxim: When interest rates hit rock bottom, the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon. This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game. Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight; halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall. This move today will undoubtedly upset some. But it must be said. In the financial world, the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay. Remember, on the night of October 15, 2025, when history turns, some will hear only the wind, while others will see the shape of the storm. Now it's your turn. Are you one of the 97% who are focused on interest rate cuts, or the 11% who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction?

It does matter which parties are invovled, be it the same or different.

All of the silly examples of people talking about their chairs or Monopoly are not examples of real economic activity.

I am an NVDA shareholder - it makes me an owner with a stake in the company.  I have purchased an NVDA GPU to put in my PC.  My PC is running Windows OS.  I'm also a MSFT shareholder.  Uh-oh - is this illegitimate or fake business?  What if I used my dividends from MSFT to buy Windows OS and my dividends from NVDA to buy my GPU?  I just paid them back with their money and nothing happened right?  Wrong.

The dividends paid out are off their books.  I could have used the money to buy anything else or save it.  But I used it to buy their products, which they collect a profit margin on.  Had a non-shareholder/owner/stakeholder made same purchase of GPU and OS, NVDA and MSFT collect same profit margin.  Again it does matter who the parties are as long as an economic transaction occurred.

Now take the example of MSFT using its own Windows OS and Office for their employees, and NVDA using their own GPU's for their desktops and workstations - in this case th product is all contained within the same company.  They did not pay themselves for it, and there is no revenue recorded.

When MSFT buys stakes in companies, it is very small/marginal, no board seats, they are just a shareholder like everyone else.  Do you know most successful corportions have a capital investment arm?  They invest in both private and public equities - I mean this has been going on for decades.",greenpride32,1,,,2025-10-16 15:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/njsf9l9/

Other examples of ""round tripping"" have been pretty blatant and concerning. This purchase (Microsoft) along with other funders, purchasing a data center company, is needed. If you've been following the news around MSFT you'd know that Microsoft data centers can't keep up with the demand for compute and inference requests. They've been scrambling to expand their existing azure data centers, and they've been scrambling to lease capacity from data centers also. 

This seems pretty straightforward. Microsoft found a data center company to buy. NVDA being connected to the funding however, this could be a round trip transaction for them, if they somehow get revenue back from this data center Corp in the form of buying more overpriced GPUs. 

These other examples of round tripping have been pretty bad though.

MSFT is buying stakes in AI companies so that the AI companies have capital to operate. Often they spend that capital at MSFT’s boutique Azure.

I guess then, that our reactions would depend on who ACME has invested in and who will buy the datacentre capacity and so forth. If ACME gave money to OpenAI so that OpenAI can buy services from it, you might be skeptical.

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.

Microsoft and Sony hardly make profit on consoles; they often lose money on console so they can lock you into their ecosystem. In November 2022, Phil Spencer said that Microsoft looses about $100-200 for every Xbox sold. 

They're sold near or below cost while games, subscriptions, DLC, and accessories are sold at markups for profit. (Nintendo does sell consoles for a profit, just different strategies.)

Getting rid of consoles would boost the profitability of the gaming division, benefitting Microsoft

Also, just by simply mathematics, boosting the gamepass subscription by 50% can only harm them if they lose 33% or more of customers. That's just not happening, and if it did, they can always just reverse it. Gamepass is still a great deal if you use it a lot, and Microsoft knows how to price things properly.

It does suck for all consumers though to see Xbox basically throwing in the towel.

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

nisrcrv,comment,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"I’m convinced **$PATH (UiPath)** is one of the few actually *undervalued* AI plays left. Everyone keeps sleeping on it because they think it’s just some boring automation company from 2018, but that’s missing the whole shift that’s happening right now.

RPA (robotic process automation) was basically teaching bots to click buttons and do repetitive crap for humans. Now that’s turning into the **guardrails** and **action layer** for AI agents. LLMs can “think,” but they still suck at *doing* stuff safely inside enterprise systems. UiPath already built that entire control layer years ago, and it’s profitable, loaded with cash, and already inside Fortune 500 companies.

Fundamentals are actually solid for once:  
$1.5B revenue, 85% margins, positive cash flow, no major debt, $1.7B in cash just chilling.  
Valuation? Around 8–9x forward sales, while the shiny AI names trade at double or triple that.

Analysts got price targets around $30–$38, stock’s sitting around $20. Do the math.

They’re teaming up with Microsoft, AWS, Nvidia: basically the holy trinity of AI infrastructure — and their renewal rate is over 120%. Meanwhile, most “AI” companies are burning cash like there’s no tomorrow.

Risks? Sure. If they don’t nail the pivot from bots to full-on AI orchestration, they’ll just stagnate. But if they do? UiPath becomes the **middleware that connects AI to the real world**.

""In addition, cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for employee stock option and purchase plans. The buyback program has not kept pace with employee stock option grants or exercises. Beginning in fiscal 1990, Microsoft has repurchased 710 million common shares while 1.79 billion shares were issued under the Company’s employee stock option and purchase plans. The market value of all outstanding stock options was $69 billion as of June 30, 1999. Microsoft enhances its repurchase program by selling put warrants. During December 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible exchangeable preferred stock. Net proceeds of $980 million were used to repurchase common shares. In December 1999, each preferred share is convertible into common shares or an equivalent amount of cash determined by a formula that provides a floor price of $79.875 and a cap of $102.24 per preferred share, equivalent to $19.97 and $25.56 per common share.""

From 1996-1999, they repurchased $980 million.

There was $1T in share repurchases last year.  As the free float decreases the affect of decreasing liquidity is not linear.  So buying back shares for the last decade has created an entirely different mechanic than in 1999.

With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

 

Notable:

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48
4 Companies from 1999 had a positive return through 2006. 
5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

ninc4ig,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,What would you sell?,"Late to the party but I have a strategy that would work pretty dang well for your scenario. You wouldn't need to sell and take capital gains, you could just pull liquidity from your account, similar to an SBLOC. But better lol

I’m going to keep this surface level:

It’s particularly well known that individuals with brokerage accounts can use those assets as collateral and borrow against it. However, if you look on Schwab/Fidelity/BoA/etc. it isn’t worth it in many situations because of the rate alone. What many don’t know is that if you (or someone with experience in this) executes a derivative box strategy within that account, it’s essentially creating a synthetic, risk-free loan because it has a defined outcome. You can, therefore, access your capital at the SOFR rate while allowing your money to continue growing in the brokerage account.

Where this would be extremely relevant with your situation is this loan creates capital losses through the interest payments so whenever you DO decide to sell you could potentially eliminate capital gains entirely. At the same time, you can pull liquidity now, finance your house, and let your investments continue to grow.

nigkund,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,What would you sell?,"> But Tesla’s valuation isn’t about how many cars it sells today, it’s about the potential of the ecosystem it’s building.

I am aware:

> > The others have some real operations going for them. If AI/Cloud slows down MS still has their OS and Office, Amazon still has server space and a store, Google and Meta still have their ads, and Apple still has their hardware. 

Your reasoning as to why Tesla is a good company is something I am pointing out as to why they are not. They are way too old to be a start up. Their manufacturing isn't as good as traditional cars and they are closing the gap on their electric offerings. Everyone else still has a product to keep them on top. Tesla hardly makes cars and with out the future hype they are not that much better than BYD or traditional manufacturers that offer electric. 

Take for example; Apple has put a lot of work into their ARM stuff. MS has not and it shows that MS is still on the prototype stage. Could MS be better than a macbook in the future as they push updates? Maybe, but what matters is how hardware is today and their willingness to push through. Tesla has been stuck on FSD being beta. Waymo seemingly already has one. In a sense they are like MS with ARM. They keep making claims about what they could do, but the delivery is still in ""its a start up so there are some edges that need to be polished"". Everyone else has something in production. Which my point is that everyone else has a real business to fall back on. MS could cut their windows on ARM and still be a solid company. Tesla cutting their FSD means they have no real product to sell out side of the brand name. 

Here is some homework for you; when did Elon first say FSD would be ready? Would you put up with that if you bought bespoke hardware that will be better at some point in the future? Pay a premium when you could just have a comparable competitor at a lower price with the same features minus the promise that it will get fixed in the future?",Wild_Alternative3563,1,,,2025-10-08 19:55:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/nigkund/

nig5pm1,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles,"Mag 7 are good companies, the problem is valuations. They are priced based on the assumption that the past couple year's earnings growth will continue for a decade straight.

This is problematic when you consider that most of the earnings growth has occurred because of unprofitable customers making speculative bets on AI. In most cases, there isn't any actual value being created for the end user that would result in long term earnings potential.

For example, Google Nano banana and Sora 2 are really cool, but where is the value added here? People will have fun for a few weeks making memes, but eventually people get tired of the AI slop and people forget about it. It happened with AI image generation, it happened with AI music gen, and it will happen with videos.

Or on the enterprise side, 95% of AI projects fail to achieve a positive ROI. So while there is a lot of money going into AI in an attempt to follow trends, this trend is not paying off. What happens when companies trim their budgets on AI due to poor ROI?

What happens to the earnings of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia if demand for computing resources stops growing or declines? Microsoft/Amazon/Google either get stuck with computing resources they can't lease, or there is a race to the bottom in prices as they are leased at a loss. And then orders for Nvidia/Broadcom dry up",skilliard7,1,,,2025-10-08 18:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/nig5pm1/
nig0any,comment,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"As a software engineer with 8 years in the industry, I approve this message.

I've spent the last few weeks digging into UiPath to see what all the hype is about. Here's my honest take: their older automation products have real limitations. A lot of companies are still using these legacy systems not because they're great, but because migrating away would be expensive and messy, classic technical debt situation. But their new agentic AI platform? That's a different story. It actually solves a lot of these problems.

When I first heard about it, my immediate reaction as a dev was: ""Why do I need UiPath to build an agent? i can just build an agent on my own?

Fair question. And honestly, you *could*. But here's the thing UiPath has spent years building out all the boring infrastructure stuff. They've got pre-built connectors for everything: email systems, Google Drive, SAP, Salesforce, you name it. Plus intelligent document processing, API integrations, and orchestration tools that actually work at enterprise scale.

oh also their new product is drag and drop kind of thing, companies dont need to hire devs to build products. can hire a technical business analysts to do it. which is HUGE.

If I wanted to build a custom agent using Microsoft's framework, I'd need to build all of those integrations myself. We're talking weeks or months of development time just to get to the starting line. With UiPath, that entire foundation is already there. I can focus on solving the actual business problem instead of reinventing the wheel.

Don't get me wrong, Microsoft's Agent Framework is solid, especially if you're already deep in their ecosystem. But for enterprise automation where you need to connect to dozens of different systems? UiPath's head start matters. A lot.",iambatman18x,57,,,2025-10-08 18:16:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/nig0any/
nifpy4j,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles,"It's not just how high the bubble is. It's how low the floor is getting for the actual economy. How much are people spending money. Think of the effects something like the amount of immigrants leaving/dramatically less coming into the US has. The farmers who can't find workers to pick crops without immigrants. The small businesses that have closed. 

It's just basic math that a declining population has to have immigration otherwise they're screwed in the long term. The more declining the current population is the more you need immigration. And the US desperately relies on it and always has. 

That's just one thing. Think of how much Vegas relies on tourism which is way down. All the young workers who rely on tips and use that money to go out with friends who can't do that with massively reduced tips.

Think of all the people who have cut a tighter budget in places where energy has suddenly risen by 70% due to AI and them spending less. The future of businesses thst rely on Candian and Mexican tourists and the flow on effect of more job losses. The grim job loss figures being much worse than pictured because agriculture isn't counted. 

I feel like some people who invest are living in a bubble (no pun intended) and need to consider the situation more holistically. Go and chat to some random people about how they're feeling and how they're spending money. Just ask on a subbreddit that takes any question or something. Really look around and think how can this shit really last before a panic sets in.

These things have a knock on effect on stocks eventually. 

When the nifty 50s were rising things were actually great for the average Joe money wise. Same in the lead up to the Great Depression. It's not really the same. There is no precedent you can use for how bad it is because no one has done to the economy what Trump has done. You can say bubbles can last 10 years but the effects of a bad leader are supposed to be really felt after their terms ends. Look at how long Trump has been in office this time and what's already been happening. These things aren't normal.

Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.*

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

**Ziptrader** (800k subs on youtube) made PATH his #1 pick

**My Position:** November, December, and January calls + shares. Planning to add more, as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks. I'm using my gambling account, and I got permission from my wife's boyfriend to use her account and start another position.

**TLDR: PATH is an established player in AI and Robotics, has signed major deals with NVDA, openAI, CRM, SNOW, and MSFT, but the stock price has not reflected their potential growth. PT: 50+**

  
**UPDATE: 10/15/2025**

Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on 10/10/25 Made me take profit on November/December calls. Up $30k

Still Holding January Calls below, and shares. Will look to add to position again as market recovers:

But let me add some detail to this...

They're looking at the P/E of Microsoft and Amazon. Fine. There are two sides to Microsoft and Amazon. There's a good, stable business. Licensing software, selling you USB leads, and some boring old cloud hosting. Then there's a prediction based on their cloud growth. Like there is around half of Oracle price that is not dependant on AI. They still sell boring old licenses for databases and some enterprise software.

Also, they're using Forward P/Es that are based on it continuing to grow and we just do not know that. What happens when OpenAI floats and people start demanding it make profits rather than burning money?

I would also go as far as to say that one indicator of a bubble is people writing things saying ""it's not a bubble"". Goldman aren't writing this for fun, or to be helpful to you.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

That’s 10,000+ contracts at an average of $17.58, which is wild considering that strike is way out of the money right now.

Now, I’m holding the 555 calls for Oct 17, so I’m still on the bullish side short-term, but this kind of flow definitely caught my eye. When you see that kind of premium size and open interest this low (OI only 12), that means these are new positions, not some roll-over. Somebody’s loading up for a possible pullback or they’re hedging size ahead of next month.

If you look at the timing, this trade came in heavy right around noon yesterday. Big block order, probably an institution or fund putting protection in. Could be nothing more than a hedge on long tech exposure, but it could also mean someone’s anticipating a decent-sized correction once earnings or macro data hit.

I’m not changing my 555C plan yet, momentum’s still holding for now, but if I start seeing open interest stack up on these deep puts and volume confirming downside, I’ll probably flip or hedge. For now, I’m just watching if this turns into a chain reaction setup or just a whale hedge move. Attached is my charting for the daily and the screenshot from UW.

To put it in perspective: hyperscalers (Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft) likely drive 5–10× more demand for optical interconnects than what a singular AI project like OpenAI’s would require (just an estimate, but directionally reasonable given scale differences).

￼ They do have a collaboration with Foxconn Interconnect Technology (FIT) to build 800G / 1.6T pluggable optical modules using POET’s silicon photonics engine.  ￼ But that’s a far cry from “Foxconn has clinched the OpenAI datacenter optical deal.” That latter claim isn’t substantiated.

Also, $75 million is chicken feed in this space many incumbents spend far more annually on R&D, infrastructure, and deployments.

1o0ja1l,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$POET - Someone Just Dropped $75M In and Won't Say Who (We Find Out Oct 17),"Alright so I've been digging into this POET Technologies thing because of that dumb fuck who keeps posting shit about them in the DDs so I said what the hell I'll take a look.

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

How is it a good company? I'm aware that their stock keeps doing well, but its clearly among the worst car companies and the tech gap they had with others is closing. Besides the cult of personality and government protection that keeps BYD out; what do they have going for them?

The others have some real operations going for them. If AI/Cloud slows down MS still has their OS and Office, Amazon still has server space and a store, Google and Meta still have their ads, and Apple still has their hardware.

I'm not against going r/wallstreetbets and trying to yolo some Tesla.

there are not super many services that warrent REAL cloud infrastructure imho.   
stable SAP / ERP is the primary example that comes to mind. why would I ever host something that is sized according to users a, licenses and revenue in a real cloud , when I do not need variable / flexible scaling mechanisms ? 

even on high availability servers in a max tier datacenter, most dedicated servers and infrastructure would still be cheaper than buying the same services off of azure or aws.

the studies have been out for years about hidden costs and vendor lock  in on actual cloud hyperscaler technology.

$RGTI The Reality Check: Revenue and Margins Collapse

On paper, Rigetti is doing what every moonshot tech company does telling us about the future. But in the present, the numbers don’t inspire much confidence.

🔹Revenue dropped 41.6% last quarter.

🔹Gross margins halved from 64% to 31%.

🔹The expiration of the National Quantum Initiative funding hurt results (though there’s a chance Congress renews it).

The CEO sold ALL of his shares at $12 a few months ago. He owns no direct shares. 

They only did 1.7M in revenue last quarter and they are trading at a 15B+ market cap. 

To its credit, Rigetti raised $350M through an ATM offering, pushing its cash pile to $572M. That’s enough runway for a couple of years, but it came at the cost of heavy shareholder dilution.

In other words: Rigetti has breathing room, but not without watering down existing investors.

This stock went up like 25% last week because they sold 2 computers for 5 million dollars. Its valuation is insane. They will almost certainly dilute stock holders so they can raise $ for their incredibly capital intensive business. 

Please be careful and don’t fall for “hype” 

There is no business, or way to success for $RGTI. 

Please buy companies with good growth, and solid fundamentals like $AMZN, $MSFT, etc and let pigs get slaughtered.

Right off the bat, that's enough to get my ears to perk up, as I assumed it would have something to do with Chromebooks and ChromeOS. However, Osterloh's response didn't mention ChromeOS or Chromebooks once.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but that sure sounded like Google is working on something major, with Osterloh trying to remain as tight-lipped about it as possible. Then, Amon let another cat out of the bag, as he replies with ""It's incredible. It delivers on the conversion from mobile to PC. I can't wait to have one."" So not only is this a separate platform from say, Windows, but it sure sounded like Google's working on some new hardware.

Immediately, I was reminded of the ""Pixel Laptop"" rumor that was making its rounds in late 2024, which was initially said to be running ChromeOS.

Nope.

What you mean is ""grandma isn't torrenting anymore."" There will always be a portion of people that pirate. Software companies know that there's a certain % of people that will get the game/movie/show/music/book no matter what. The goal is to keep that % small. 

The pendulum swings back and forth. In the glory days, I paid for Netflix and it was fantastic to just have everything there without needing to go download it. Once it shattered into 100 different streaming services, I pulled out my eyepatch and peg leg and went right back to sailing the seas. 

We've gone from ""don't copy that floppy"" to asking for the 5th word on the 3rd page of the user manual. 

From passing around the Windows 95 CD to activation codes that were verified online. 

From Napster to fake names on files that were audio garbage in Kazaa. 

From one time keys to always on verification.

From ripping DVD's to HDCP violations when you have a bad HDMI cable for BluRays.

If you're not familiar with Linux this might seem foreign but this should give you enough context to search around Google and YouTube to find instructions.  The Arch Wiki entry for RClone might be a good resource too, even if you won't be using Arch.  I suggest getting something simple like Ubuntu in a virtual machine for testing.  Don't nuke your Windows install just to get stuck and be without it trying to troubleshoot.  Get comfortable in a controlled environment first.  RClone will work on any distro.  You *will* need to use the terminal to set this up effectively, which isn't a lot for this, but trust me, youll thank me later because you'll have full context of every step of the way and makes troubleshooting easy.

The short version is, you can make a directory in your home folder dedicated to it, then put an entry in your /etc/fstab file so it'll automatically mount your RClone configuration (That being your OneDrive mount point) when you boot your PC.",tychii93,1,,,2025-10-03 11:22:52,https://www.theverge.com/news/784381/qualcomm-ceo-seen-googles-android-pc-merger-incredible,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nwif2h/googl_getting_ready_to_enter_pc_and_operating/nhilkpq/

Appears that $GOOGL $GOOG will be entering the P/C/Laptop world with a Operating system based on Android that allows for Apps to be downloaded directly onto the PC.

Think this was much needed and will help break the monopoly that Microsoft has.

I current have to pay $70 for personal Microsoft office products (word/excel). I stopped paying last year and have since used Google office products which have been free and seen no issues.

Would love to see more Google apps available more easily on the home screen.

Not a easy task going against Microsoft - but lets see how it plays out. They did this with Chromebook in 2011 and made it the biggest laptops for education in the world. A gamble that paid off.

1nwhavv,post,options,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Anyone else watching the AI power bottleneck? ($BE, hyperscalers, and options setups)","Been digging into the whole AI infrastructure trade and realized something: everyone talks chips ($NVDA, $AMD) or software ($MSFT, $GOOGL), but the **grid might be the real bottleneck.**

Data centers are sucking up power at a pace the utilities can’t keep up with. That’s why weird names like **$BE (Bloom Energy)** are ripping — they can deploy mobile/clean on-site power fast, which hyperscalers might need if the grid lags.

The bull case is obvious: AI capex is basically bottomless right now. But the bear case is interesting too — what if demand for power simply can’t be met? That could stall capex cycles, delay purchases, and hit the whole ecosystem.

From a trading perspective:

* Volatility in these names cuts both ways

Not advice, just sharing how I’m thinking about it. Curious if anyone else is setting up trades on the “AI power gap”?

When I fuck around with Azure's AI Foundry, I just choose a model that best fits my use case from what's basically a marketplace, almost like choosing a flavor of Linux OS for a VM.

Here’s how I see it:

* Short term: it’s going to push costs higher. $14B isn’t pocket change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this weighs on margins in upcoming quarters.
* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

Personally, I like seeing this move. It reminds me of when Amazon poured billions into AWS back in the day. Painful upfront, but it turned into one of their biggest growth engines.

What do you all think? Smart long-term play or reckless spending?

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

ngwklid,comment,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"My portfolio / €1000,- each month (no advice, just your opinion)","No worries, of your picks I like ASML, Alphabet, Alibaba and Microsoft the most. ASML is essentially a monopoly and aiming to grow EPS 20% each year for the next 5 years. Alphabet has a lower PE than the rest of the Mag 7 but a lot of the 'easy' gains are gone, as a long term pick this could do really well assuming no major disruption with LLMs and has many growing/speculative bets (Waymo, growing YouTube, other investments etc). Alibaba was a better pick at the dip recently (isn't that always the case?!) but I'm not against it for longer term although recent run up has been quick and high (frothy market). Microsoft is essentially a monopoly with good margins, return on equity and growth on dividends. Trades at a higher multiple as a result. Depends on how much time you want to dedicate to stocks etc and research, if your looking for a 'set and forget' average into investments each month or not. If your looking for minimal time and growing/compounding longer term then sticking to ETFs with low costs would be the sensible starting point. I would caution on S&P 500 at the moment though, some of the companies valuations are extremely wild (Tesla I am looking at you!).

also, the SP500 might be underperforming. the only companies actually pulling its performance up are basically the same that you can find in any nasdaq-100 etf, like QQQ. So I'd opt for QQQ instead of VOO/SPY with the same balancing.

1ntu5to,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"My portfolio / €1000,- each month (no advice, just your opinion)","Hi everybody,

Today I turned 22, and I thought, why not share what I’m doing when trying to invest. I’d love to hear any feedback and your opinion. 

So me (m22) started investing since this week and i currently deposited like €2000,- into my account down below, which i can afford. My long term goal is to build financial wealth through consistent investing. I currently earn like €3000,- net per month, and I plan to invest €1000,- of that every month into the following portfolio down below: 

My current portfolio on Trading 212 looks like this;

- Microsoft (3%) €60,-
- JPMorgan Chase & Co (5%) €125,-
- iShares Physical Gold (5%) €100,-
- Alibaba (5%) €100,-
- ASML (6%) €120,-
- Alphabet (Class A) (7%) €140,-
- Rolls-Royce (9%) €180,-
- iShares Core S&P 500 acc (30%) €600,-
- iShares Core MCSI World acc (30%) €600,-

I’d love to hear your thoughts on my portfolio. Do you think the allocation is reasonable? Should I consider changing anything for better long term growth or risk management? I’m new to this and would admire any insights.

The other question I have is: do you have any suggestions for a young investor trying to maximize growth while staying diversified? For reference: I still live with my parents

Thanks!!!

La solution c'est LibreOffice mais le problème est que c'est vraiment ""janky"" et il y a des fonctionnalités manquantes assez ennuyante des fois.

Oui complètement, je pense au brain drain, il y en a beaucoup qui vont en Silicon Valley effectivement, mais en fait même dans l'Europe, rien qu'en Allemagne ou en Suisse tu peux trouver un job bien mieux payé si t'as un bon CV.

C'est le problème Français de sur-valoriser les bureaucrates/HR au dépend des profils techniques et surtout une incapacité à commercialiser correctement. 

Techniquement la France forme des supers ingés qui très souvent font du super boulot et innovent, mais après on est pas foutu de vendre ça correctement. 

C'est parce qu'il y a un élitisme ambient qui considère que le commerce c'est mal et on valorise plus des postes politiques. Quelqu'un qui fait Sciences-Po va se retrouver mieux valorisé qu'un ingé qui pourtant apporte plus de valeur réelle. 

De mon point de vue, c'est de la ou part la corruption en France, quand les bureaucrates ont trop de pouvoir plus rien n'avance. Et c'est la différence fondamentale pour les écarts de rémunération avec d'autres pays...

  
Quoiqu'il en soit, ça me parait dingue qu'on ne soit pas foutu de mettre en place un système de logiciel souverain pour toute l'administration et l'éducation. Vu les sommes en jeu ça parait une évidence. Mais c'est la contradiction du système français, d'un côté on est hyper-collectivisé pour tout ce qui est au final des choix personnels (santé, retraite, etc) et de l'autre on est pas foutu d'utiliser l'avantage du collectif (la force du nombre/volume) et on va acheter des solutions sur les marchés aux autres alors que clairement le besoin est suffisamment important/généralisé pour que l'état investisse sur son territoire (avec les français, pour les français).

Microsoft is also showing that they’re willing to throw their weight around with governments through their recent pullback in Israel.

Breakeven at $308 isn’t crazy, it’s just a question of timing. You’ve got  about 80 days, which is enough for a move, but if $280 breaks clean you’re in trouble because of the negative gamma pocket under there,could flush into $275 real quick.

ngonvty,comment,europe,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,This European military just ditched Microsoft for open-source LibreOffice - here's why,"Depends on the company.

Fortune500 would be Unfortunate500 if they wouldnt have the strategy of using specialized departments for everything they do. That is why the IT department has the sole responsibility of exactly this.

The times of ""a sysadmin is only setting up a workstation and takes care of maintaining servers"" is long ago. Customized Software made inhouse is the standard since 20 years (!?) and is created every single day in all of these major companys.

The industry standard of product development in tech industry clearly is to have teams of different professions (Managers, Design, UX, Engineering,  ...) paired with fast release cycles (no Waterfall approach of creating the perfect product first before it will be released - instead Incremental methods of releasing new features rather quick and focus on the next feature with every new release).

They dont need months to create the software you need - they need hours and you may have it the next day or at the end of the week... (depending on complexity. Some Spreadsheet replacement may be ready the same or next day!)

And if you experienced this industry standard yourself already (?) than I do wonder how one can not see that every company and every department is using it and must use it to be efficient:

Some company with 10 employees and 10 million in revenue aside cant use this approach, sure. But they are not of my concern, and they are actually not interesting to the world regarding their impact of how the industry changes in terms of Industry 4.0.

That’s $13M+ in long-dated exposure. You don’t park that much money into 2027 LEAPS unless you’re betting on a huge move or a structural shift in the business.

I actually first spotted it through the TradeLeaks.ai scanner, and started digging into what could be fueling this.

Catalysts on the horizon:

	•	CRWV is positioning itself in the AI/datacenter + energy infrastructure space → if they land more contracts, the growth story could accelerate fast.

	•	There’s chatter about potential partnerships with bigger tech names that need stable fiber + power solutions.

... your sole argument since you started ranting against LO. You mentioned this reason to the other users prior to me, you mention it 3 times to me. If you got no further argument, than non of your critic is legit for a cooperation that has to decide of they want to spend $100.000 on licensing some Windows E1 or E3 license for a couple of years, just due to some boring autocomplete, or decide for LO when its actually free, and grants you autonomy and souveranity, and most important IS OPEN SOURCE AND THEREFOR CAN BE CHANGED BY YOURSELF WITHIN SECONDS!

Any major company with a billion in revenue could now take 2 of their 10.000 employees and task them to create a commit to the LO repository and add your feature ...

... so that is why you seem to forget to consider questions that are more important for managment and the future of a company than some boring feature that no on is actually missing.

""It absolutely is. Opening up a blank spreadsheet and typing =BIN""

Bullshit. Do I need to screenrecord that a simple Laptop starts LO Calc in <1 sec with a blank spreadsheet and it has 0 delay entering =BIN ...

Why would you even make up this shit if anyone can prove you wrong in 2.5 seconds while actually testing and confirming it themselfs... omg dude.

""Wow so the OS that over 70% of people use?""

70% of HOME USERS!

99% of Servers are Linux, 99% of Webservices run on Linux machines, 99% of Internet Infrastrucutre (DNS, Routing etc) is Linux (except some jackass MS Exchange Servers no one cares for), 99% of AI Services are trained and run on Linux!, 50-90% of academics and their specialized math, physics, chemics, etc. software is Linux, my entire Government decided 10 years ago to fully commit to Linux, major Company with billions of revenue solely use Linux, ...

Yet some defensive Windows user wants to make the point why his boring, narrow, usercase of being ""nothing"" to the world of tech is the reason why his cute point and click GUI stuff in some Spreadsheet (which already is the most demanding task you likely have as all the rest will be checking emails, playing media and surfing the web...) is depending on autocomplete which is why they only can use MS Excel but no LO, no Linux, no nothing :P",2BeTheFlow,1,,,2025-09-28 19:22:56,https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-european-military-just-ditched-microsoft-for-open-source-libreoffice-heres-why/,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nrpkw8/this_european_military_just_ditched_microsoft_for/ngok890/

No Fortune500 would work with some Spreadsheet on a Windows System when they can deploy MS Access and have a dedicated database with a customized Frontend for Users.

Your claim that you cant host some IMAP/SMTP with  SMIME is beyond my knowledge, and I also never sysadmined PAM with smart cards - but I know it works cus the freaking german goverment uses Smart Cards in every office and using Linux Distros :) in addition, I use a Smart Card Reader with Linux (NixOS) - no issues.

Le géant de la technologie a bloqué l'accès après que nous ayons révélé que l'armée israélienne avait utilisé ses serveurs pour stocker des millions d'appels téléphoniques interceptés de Palestiniens.

Selon le Guardian, l'unité 8200 a rapidement transféré la masse de données de surveillance des serveurs de Microsoft à l'étranger quelques jours après la publication de notre enquête ; selon leurs sources, l'unité prévoyait de transférer les données vers la plateforme cloud Amazon Web Services, dont l'armée dépend de plus en plus depuis le 7 octobre.

Pourtant, de nombreux autres projets militaires israéliens impliquant les services Microsoft restent intacts. En janvier, une enquête menée par +972, Local Call et le Guardian, basée sur des documents divulgués par le ministère israélien de la Défense et la filiale israélienne de Microsoft, a révélé que le géant technologique « est présent dans toutes les principales infrastructures militaires d'Israël », des dizaines d'unités de l'armée israélienne – notamment dans les forces aériennes, terrestres et navales – s'appuyant sur les services cloud de Microsoft.

 De plus, pendant la période la plus intense des bombardements aériens israéliens sur Gaza, les ventes de services d'IA de Microsoft au ministère israélien de la Défense ont considérablement augmenté.

Look i get it. Linux is great and dominates large parts of the computing industry, but hardware support alone kills any thought of mass adoption in my field. We are a Dell shop and on 90% of any laptop that they sell you can not get pro support unless window's is installed. On the software side I would need to pay for either RHEL or Ubuntu subscriptions for each workstation to get support. The windows license comes with the Dell. I also work closely with the DoD and have to deal with something called SMIME and email encryption and you cant even run the certificate installer on linux. Have ever tried to get PAM and pkcs to work with smart cards? its lots of fun let me tell you. We also have to LUKS encrypt every volume and bitlocker is much easier to use and manage in AD/Azure. i also have issues with wired 802.1x and have to set MABs for the linux machines a lot of time. Then I have to ask is it really worth my time to teach a 70 year old admin person how to use cifs and kerberos to mount the smb share.

ngn8lgz,comment,france,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Souveraineté numérique : l’Île-de-France remplace Microsoft par des solutions françaises pour centraliser les données des lycéens,"> Libre Office est la suite de Open Office. 

non.

openoffice c'est créé et développé par Sun Microsystems sur la base de staroffice pour faire une suite office libre et gratuite en concurrence à microsoft. sachant que staroffice était développé initialement par stardivisions qui a été racheté par sun, et que staroffice comportant du logiciel propriétaire privateur.

quand oracle rachète sun et prends le contrôle d'openoffice et de staroffice en 2009, ils fusionnent les deux pour faire oracle openoffice et la nouvelle direction inquiète à la fois les contributeurs et les usagers, le code de go-oo un fork de openoffice existant et évoluant de son coté depuis 6 ans va alors être fusionné pour créer libreoffice avec le support de the document foundation. go-oo disparait.  
de son coté oracle laisse openoffice plus ou moins à l'abandon et décide de s'en séparer en 2011 et de le donner à la fondation apache, qui le récupère et le gère depuis.

donc la suite d'openoffice c'est apache openoffice, tandis que libreoffice c'est la suite de go-oo. et aujourd'hui les branches co-existent en parallèle. mais openoffice évolue très peu, les nouvelles versions sont très lentes à sortir (version 4.1 depuis 2014), des failles de sécurité connues ne sont pas corrigées, et il est largement considéré en fin de vie depuis 2020 mais la fondation apache refuse de le reconnaitre et de rediriger vers libreoffice.",grutiere,0,,,2025-09-28 15:23:02,https://www.latribune.fr/article/tech/informatique/87093664157841/souverainete-numerique-l-ile-de-france-remplace-microsoft-par-des-solutions-francaises-pour-centraliser-les-donnees-des-lyceens,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1nrwr5b/souveraineté_numérique_lîledefrance_remplace/ngn8lgz/

There is no game so far that wasnt running on my Linux Laptop, except of Kernel-based-AC like LoL.

And than there is Lutris ... and so forth.

LLMs are your best friend: ChatGPT knows quite everything about Linux there is to know. Just install some Distro you like (Distrowatch.com tells you which one you prefer. If in doubt: Ubuntu with Gnome will always work and offer any software you need! No need to get into all these small Distros like CachyOS or similar), open Firefox, start ChatGPT, and than ask her to to install Elden Ring on Ubuntu (most likely just Steam?), after that you try to start the Game - if it wont start, open protondb.com, check what other users tell you, and if that confuse you, start asking ChatGPT and it will navigate you step by step.

I have been a Windows Desktop user since the XP days, and just last year I ditched my Windows 10 for Linux. 

Yes it was challenging, yes I did nuke my system like 2 times last year, but once the storm calms down, and you know your way around things, you tend to solve problems within a matter for seconds.

  
Also my favorite Linux feature is; I should mention I use Ubuntu based Distro, is the fact that I can update my computer and multitask, which isn't possible on Windows.

  
I am sure there are significant more pros than cons for Windows, but from personal experience, preference, and my daily utilization, I am glad to have switched over.

ngifieg,comment,europe,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft forced to make Windows 10 extended security updates truly free in Europe,"If you really wanted, and it meets security hardware requirements, you can just plug in a USB with the Win11 installer and upgrade to 11. The CPU requirement isn't a hard requirement like TPM is.

That said, you've had 8 years of software updates, 3 beyond what the EU requires for smartphones. This is hardly an issue of horrible planned obsolescence. Before that era there's a lot less support for secure boot, TPM, and other modern features that improve security. Computers that old have hardware that oftentimes don't support newer DCH drivers which microsoft is moving towards only supporting. The older hardware running older drivers just won't be as reliable, and that will result in perceived poor reliability of the OS. At some point there has to be a cut off so the average consumer has a decent experience. Even with all that said, Microsoft has made it so it's incredibly easy to remove all security requirements so you can just upgrade to 11.

Download Rufus, feed it the Win11 ISO, check off the boxes to remove various requirements and you're good to go.

The upgrade from a 7th gen to current gen mobile chip *is* a quantum leap. It's like 100's% better in performance. It will do everything you're doing faster.

I'm not against Linux. I have an old Thinkpad from the same era running Ubuntu, and probably soon Mint so I can play around with it.

I don't want to sound like I'm arguing just to argue but It's not menial. Their entire career as a respectful and responsible software developer relies on their capacity to refine and patch major vulnerabilities, yet often times **they don't**.

In respect to my last comment, *Microsoft* is pretty good with patching vulnerabilities and also paying people well who find them, but their reputation as a company relies on it. 

But I can name dozens of companies that don't, and in fact many will get upset at ethnical hackers who chain together vulnerabilities into a big exploit and bring it to their attention.

It's an external tool that can, among many other things, read and write Excel files. (But lots of non-microsoft products can do that too. Not sure where top commenter is going with this)

Now Power Query is probably where 99% of users would benefit from learning. It creates a data connection (from an excel file, a csv file, an entire folder of files, a sql database, a website, etc), and you can crunch this data before loading it into Excel (into a named table). Very useful for repetitive tasks.

What this means is that you don't have to recreate a file each time. You build the logic and calculations and after that you just click refresh data every time you need it. It's not limited by the number of lines either, I've loaded over a billion invoice lines and crunched them before loading into Excel with no problem before.",ValgrimTheWizb,10,,,2025-09-27 14:00:20,https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-european-military-just-ditched-microsoft-for-open-source-libreoffice-heres-why/,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nrpkw8/this_european_military_just_ditched_microsoft_for/nggsqv2/

The EU should develop its own system, or, perhaps even better, outsource it to European software companies and fund it for as long as it takes, until we have an actual alternative to American office and operating systems.

Linux right now is not an alternative for MS, Apple, or even Google Chrome. Before you start with Linux, you first have to make a choice between the (literally) hundreds of distributions. No one wants to do that. That's when 99.9% of the people walk away screaming from Linux. And that's why it only has a couple of million users in the world.

So, yeah, when you try the first time it can be scarry, but back then there was no youtube or smartphones/tablets so if your install broke (and has to be said OSes back then were more fragile and got corrupted way more easily) you were essentially off line and unable to get your system back without outside help. Now following a couple of youtube tutorials and have a prepared bootable USB drive is enough, heck you can follow the steps from your smartphone as you install.

Think of 30k invoices a day. UI path didn't do OCR component. Just orchestrating workflow or rather documents in and out of OCR platform  . We had around 70VMs across 4 UI Path processes. It didn't scale nicely with our growth.  Basically we had to add more  VMs constantly to meet our growth and  SLA demands

I was tasked to look at the stack and half of the tasks were basically UIPath C# scripts running on VMs -  which was insane. Other  processes that  used a traditional  RPA, could be replaced with scraping/APIs. They were also slow. 1-4 minutes for tasks that can be executed in seconds. Issue with balancing. During peak business hours some processes required more bots. We had to allocate 1 FTE just to ""balance the bots ""

When we presented these findings to the Vendor they (a UIPath vendor) did offer to rewrite the whole stack using agents (at that time a new thing ) 

But commercials were still expensive and the timeline to rebuild  was like 8 months , when compared to building from scratch on alternative stack - Mulesoft, Azure , AWS ...with 3 months timelines . UI path solution was literally at the bottom of the list out of all options we looked at ... with the highest  build cost, delivery time and scaling for growth by 2 fold at least

Anyone who uses Windows could jump right into just about any Linux environment, except for maybe Gnome (but probably even that without too much issue). Proton has also made a lot of Steam games a legitimate option on Linux as well. The problem is that you're almost certainly going to run into something that doesn't work before long, and end up spending hours on forums looking for advice and copying and pasting commands in. I switched a couple months ago, and in that time, I had to change distros due to KDE being unstable. I had a Steam game that would cause random kernel panics, I spent 2 hours getting a printer installed, and a kernel update broke my network driver, so I had to roll it back. On the plus side, some sort of update did eventually fix my kernel panics, so that's nice, but I can't imagine the average user putting up with what I have.

And, the consumer always wins. It will be a price war. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Xia/Tesla all offer something else to make money off and will win the price war for pure play AI as it turns into a commodity like access to the internet

I will add that in the end everything gets commoditized unless you have monopoly power. With the hyperscalers, China, India, and smaller US operations doing it you can switch and churn in an out of each of the AI chatbots. Again the consumer always wins.

And, the power needs 10GW for stargate is insane, we are talking 100s of millions of dollars for electricity if not more since they will have to subsidize the build out. Cooling is another massive cost. How will they make money charging people $200 per month. There will be a price war as they will have to charge closer to $2000 per month but then Apple will come out with its in phone AI that doesnt touch the cloud as much for an extra $400 and these hyperscalers will pull there hair out.

ngae1hf,comment,europe,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft forced to make Windows 10 extended security updates truly free in Europe,"I just put down a deposit on a Framework laptop after realising that they now have more than one GPU choice (An RTX 5070?  Yes please!).  Before then, having a ""modular"" GPU was rather pointless.

Previously spent 10+ years on Linux (and Slackware Linux at that!) as my primary OS while managing Windows networks, so not scared to do so at all again.  Windows 11 just pisses me off for no sensible reason (why can't I just choose where the start menu is?  Why is everything cloud/account first?  No I don't want Edge.  No I don't want you to try to convince me to use Edge.  No I don't want Edge to sneak back on and ask me again.  Same for OneDrive, Copilot, etc.)

Now I own a Steam Deck, I'm also convinced on the maturity of Linux gaming (I never run AAA anyway, but always nice to have the power to do so).  Thanks, Valve.  I knew you could do it, even from the early days of the Steam machines.

And my current gaming laptop is starting to mechanically fall apart, especially the keyboard - fortunately I have a spare but I'm slowing running out of replacement keys to steal from it (my N is now another M key).  I choose to use a single machine for everything - a very powerful gaming laptop being the best-of-all-worlds... never have problems running games, never have problems transcoding video, can just sit and write a document or browse without pulling 2000W, but can also take the thing with me wherever I go, even abroad, etc.  Hell, I play VR on it and I watch movies on it and I type documents on it, it's great).

So I put down a deposit on a Framework with great specs, great expansion (I CAN CHOOSE WHAT PORTS I WANT!!!  I JUST WANT LOTS OF USB-C!!!), and the ability to change the keyboard when the keys start to fall out without it involving dismantling half the laptop and sourcing impossible-to-obtain parts.

But honestly, what's driven me here?  Windows 11.  If it was vaguely configurable and didn't try to trick me into sending my data to America all the time, I probably wouldn't bother to change and would just get any other Windows laptop.  My software is all free, open-source or cross-platform anyway.

But now I'm at the point where I think ""No, let's get something designed NOT to be a Windows machine"" for my main machine.  Probably for the first time in my life (my other main machines were put onto Linux later, and I run dozens of smaller Linux machines).

Microsoft put me off their own product, nobody else.  To the point that I will happily suffer the extra added expense, hassle, configuration, undoubted problems (systemd, grr!), etc. in order to escape it.

For the first time in years, I'm actually thinking ""Oh, I look forward to changing my main machine"", which is usually something I approach with utter dread (having everything just how you like on one machine and then having to move it to another is really the worst part of my tech-life... it's why I like having a single all-rounder machine doing everything and all set up how I like).",ledow,3,,,2025-09-26 13:30:13,https://www.theverge.com/news/785544/microsoft-windows-10-extended-security-updates-free-europe-changes,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nquogc/microsoft_forced_to_make_windows_10_extended/ngae1hf/

ng9yrbx,comment,europe,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft forced to make Windows 10 extended security updates truly free in Europe,"To all who got stuck on Windows 10 due to TPM2 and possibly concerned about the ever more intrusive data collection, Linux has become finally a viable alternative for desktop PCs, including for gaming thanks to Wine and related Proton. Even worst case where you need Windows, there is a last backup in the form of free virtualization software.


I highly recommend Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Linux Mint Cinamon (if you have >8GB RAM) or XFCE version for those with 4GB or less. If you have tried Linux before and you know the basics I recommend Manjaro with KDE. Another European Linux distribution would be OpenSuse which also offers KDE desktop environment. I made tutorials for Ubuntu 24.04LTS and Manjaro KDE post install if you are interested. Note to backup data before installing, all is required starting from Windows would be a USB thumb drive with 16GB or more capacity, the Linux .iso file downloaded from the website and a tool called Rufus USB. For installation guide follow recent youtube tutorial for the version you want to use.

Other considerations, when downloading make sure to choose the x64 or AMD x64 or x86 64 (they basically mean the same thing, it's a standard invented by AMD but Intel also uses it) and not Arm or other versions since most will use AMD or Intel CPUs, some low end notebooks might use arm but they are a minority of the market. Before you install again backup data either on another thumb drive, drive (other than the one used to install the OS on and disconnect it after backup is made) or cloud storage. I would also recommend during installation (again your important data is safe by this point) to always choose Erase and let the installer do the partitioning, for file system generally choose ext4 or Btrfs, do NOT enable secure boot, encryption, LVM or other features if you don't know what they are and what they do, you can learn about them later. When an account is created, note it's a local account and internet connection is not required during installation if you chose the full offline .iso image, if the distribution offers (note in either case the account is still local, the connection is required for adding packages for smaller .iso files that need a connection and it is unrelated to the account).

ng9vlon,comment,europe,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft forced to make Windows 10 extended security updates truly free in Europe,"You're touching on the chicken-and-egg discussion of corporate social responsibility.

Should companies just do everything they can to make money as long as it is technically legal or should they 'nerf' themselves by implementing moral principles (like no planned obsolecense, green power etc).

One argument is that as long as there isn't a ""mommy EU"" to set the boundaries ""ethically"" if they implement consumer-friendly practices is just a competitive disadvantage and leaves a hole in the market for a competitor to get bigger. So it becomes a lesser evil type deal, and responsibility is dilluted in public companies.

I think this applies in reality at least to large publically traded corporations. If they don't do absolutely everything legally possible to make shareholder value go up, investors will go to a company that is willing to do that.

But it's difficult because I don't want to remove the blame from Microsoft - the structure and economics of giant corporations just make it so the government or in this case the EU are the ones who need to enforce society's moral code through legislation.

That's the social democratic way to look at it I think.",Scottybadotty,6,,,2025-09-26 10:49:01,https://www.theverge.com/news/785544/microsoft-windows-10-extended-security-updates-free-europe-changes,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nquogc/microsoft_forced_to_make_windows_10_extended/ng9vlon/

ng7qar7,comment,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,I’m not selling. NBIS,"$NBIS. A full-stack ai cloud datacenter and much more. Here's a dd:

The risk reward with NBIS is very strong. They have a track record at Yandex of building out 20 DCs. They know what they are doing which is why Microsoft signed the deal with them. Also NBIS is 400 engineers strong.

Two more greenfield sites will be announced by EOY & could be generating revenue by Q4 2026. NBIS could be guiding ARR of 5-10B by 2026 EOY.

Nvidia has a strategic partnership with Nebius that grants Nebius priority access to Nvidia's latest and most powerful GPUs. 

As an early adopter of NVIDIA Blackwell, Nebius worked with research group LMArena in collaboration with NVIDIA to bring LMArena’s Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L) system into production using GB200 NVL72 infrastructure.

Nebius's supercomputer, ISEG, ranked 16th on the Top 500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers.

Other companies under the group:

* **Avride:** A company that develops autonomous cars and delivery robots for sectors like ride-hailing and logistics. Their self driving car subsidiary is launching with Uber in October. They also just expanded their food delivery robots to a second college this semester.
* **TripleTen:** An edtech platform that offers training and reskilling for tech careers in the U.S. and Latin America.
* **Toloka AI:** A company that partners with businesses to provide data for developing generative AI.
* **ClickHouse:** An equity stake is held in this open-source column-oriented database management system. This doesn’t factor in a potential IPO of Clickhouse which they own just under 30% of.

Outside of Microsoft they still guided up to 1.1B ARR by Q4 2025.

Nebius Group Price Target Raised to $206 at Northland, Named New Top Pick After Microsoft Deal.

When choosing a company, always look at the debt. Their main competitor coreweave has $9 billion debt while NBIS has net cash $693 million.

* **CoreWeave (CRWV)** — **Net debt ≈ $9.00B** (Total debt $11.05B − cash & restricted cash ≈ $2.05B)
* **Nebius (NBIS)** — **Net cash ≈ $693M** (Cash $1.679B − total debt $986.2M ⇒ net **−$693M**)

Then they figured out that LLM's exist and made Maestro. Maestro will do what Palantir's Foundry does but for business admin people who are not SAP programming experts. Maestro is software that will automate Gen X's enterprise needs. Thrilling, I know. But they have a partnership with Microsoft, they beat earnings consistently. their YoY customer retention is great, and they say 'agentic ai' a lot. So calls obviously.

If you want more thorough DD, check out NYCandrun's post earlier this month. Revenue from Maestro most likely won't show up on their Q3 earnings, but in case it does I have January 2026 calls and January 2027 leaps.

1npo92f,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",r2002,255,0.83,114.0,2025-09-24 23:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/

I started at Microsoft in the 1990’s and the stock spiked.  Microsoft used to do partial compensation in stock options, and the rules at the time allowed them to deduct the capital gains, paid to their employees from their profit, although they would not report it as an expense.  They wound up spending more on compensation for stock options than they made in profit for many years.  The loophole was closed in 2005.  ( Microsoft changed from stock options to stock grants as a result).

nfviuih,comment,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,IONQ and NBIS sounds like the top dog quantum today - is it worth it to invest,"From aleabitoreddit on x and Reddit 

Thoughts on why I’m scaling my $NBIS position to $1M+ with a $225 PT:

Thesis
______
When MSFT, GOOGL, and Mag7 are your customers like ALAB or CRED (when I took large positions in both sub $100) or before $NVDA or AVGO or TSM took off, a company's forward growth would likely explode in the 100%'s of percent.

There are barely any companies in history where Mag7 are dependent on them.
On top of that, when NVDA has every incentive to pump your stock as well....

NBIS becomes a stronger buy and has my highest conviction for 1Y timeframe.

Moat + GPU lenders Critical Importance to NVDA
_______
NVDA sees other hyperscalers like AMZN, GOOGL building out their own chips and reducing reliance.

Answer? Build out GPU lenders eg. CRWV, by taking a stake and financing them, so Azure/Cloud/AWS can't replace NVDA.

Access to GPUs becomes increasingly through these lenders and as we see with OpenAI, they no longer have the compute from MSFT and have to go to GOOGL.

GOOGL also doesn't have enough compute so they go to WULF and others. MSFT goes to CRWV, NBIS and others, and big tech compute flows downstream to these GPU providers.

NVIDIA has every reason to inflate GPU lenders like CoreWeave and NBIS to hedge against hyperscaler custom chips.

And without compute, billions of dollars will flow to NBIS with NVDA propping them up.

Macro Tailwind
_______
3x rate cut priced into Polymarket.

If you saw my other post, triple rate cuts only happen once a decade (extremely positive for liquidity flowing into markets) + combined with end of year seasonality, which are positive for equities.

On top of that, NBIS is a relatively smaller market cap, and relies on financing/debt to grow. When their interest burden drops, financing gets cheaper, and expansion looks more viable.

NBIS is heavily valued on future earnings, and with rate cut projections, far our earnings of billions in rev from MSFT and other clients get marked UP. We're about to see a sharp re-rating after Fed meeting yesterday.

Company Comparisons
________

If I had to choose NBIS -> CRWV -> WULF ->others weighing on potential to speculation tradeoffs.

CRWV - NVDA clearly backing them, already large $63B+ MC. Could go way higher but growth potential with MSFT contract with NBIS, similar backlog, etc. at more than half the marketcap is why I chose them.

$IREN, BITF, RIOT, $GRRR etc. - BTC miners pivoting to compute. I like them but they don't have the same de-risking as MSFT yet.

WULF - I do like them since Google is backing them but NBIS conversion terms and MC relative to potential are better.

Fundamentals
______
MC: 24.78B (When you compare to CRWV at 61B, which was still down 30% this year), now with similar revenue backlog, it has an easy potential to go to the same marketcap ($243+ a share).

By 2026, with Microsoft deal accounted for, NBIS could be doing $5-6B total revenue with strong gross margins (≈70%).

In 2027-2028, total revenue could reach $8-10B+, especially if base business (non-Microsoft) also grows aggressively. All with ~60-75% gross margins.

This is insane but mainly due to NVDA supporting these GPU companies. Based on valuation, NBIS is more attractive than CRWV and less speculative than IREN or others without MSFT backing giving them 17B.

Misc Thoughts
___
They already raised 4.1B+ and secured capex for the $17B MSFT contract. This was the biggest de-risking event and why I'd invest in NBIS at $90+ compared to something more speculative back at $50.

There's likely other contracts from hyperscalers coming their way. I'd say easy path to $140, then maybe drop from convertible note, then up to $200.

There's probably more specifics that I didn't get to like margin compression in a few years operating income depreciation risk etc.

But this was the core of my investment thesis (macro, fundamentals, industry growth, moat + incentives) when I make investment decisions vs. swing trading and why NBIS is high conviction over the next year.",Mulletman1234567,0,,,2025-09-24 03:42:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nowy8m/ionq_and_nbis_sounds_like_the_top_dog_quantum/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nowy8m/ionq_and_nbis_sounds_like_the_top_dog_quantum/nfviuih/

1. you will soon realize that this a technology that is easily 10-15 years away from its first real world use cases that is according to the leading scientific experts in the field https://introtoquantum.org/essentials/timelines/#:~:text=The%20earliest%20commercial%20quantum%20applications,within%20reach%20around%202035%E2%80%932040.
2. you will soon come to the conclusion that by far the most advanced players in the industry are google and IBM not these random start-ups
3. NBIS is owned by Russian oligarchs or something like that so there is a significant geopolitical risk plus they are not even a real quantum company nothing in their about me page mentions quantum at all and the little products they have quantum related are not actually quantum just using standard GPUs for quantum chemistry research according to their website 
3. IONQ is a quantum company however they are behind Google and IBM and other major players in the number qubits so probably not the best investment option between a established companies with multiple other businesses and decades of research and infrastructure experience like IBM vs this start up that is exclusively doing this with not nearly as much capital and resources as IBM or google
4. IBM, Google, Microsoft, Intel and plenty of other well established companies have very advanced research (most of the time industry leading) and infrastructure in quantum 

TLDR: you are way better off getting your exposure to quantum through companies like IBM or Google then through a pure quantum play especially considering how even in the best case scenario according to Ioniq they are minimum 5 years away from having enough qubits to have real world use cases and are burning~100-300 mil per year with about ~300 mil in cash reserves so yea",fine_lit,8,,,2025-09-24 01:59:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nowy8m/ionq_and_nbis_sounds_like_the_top_dog_quantum/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nowy8m/ionq_and_nbis_sounds_like_the_top_dog_quantum/nfv1c12/

Everyone knows Nvidia invested in Open AI with 100 billions dollars. So, Open AI will get 100 billions dollars to buy Nvidia chipset for their data centers.  

If you got some knowledge about stockmarket history, this investment is typical what Cisco did with some client like ICG Communications.  
  
In the fact, Open AI is losing money and are not expecting to get money before 2028. So, Nvidia make an investment of 100 billion to allow them to buy the chipset. Yes, Nvidia makes a ""loan"" to his client because they don't have money. Cisco did the same

In AI business, lot of people make a big investment in data center because they've got money like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon ... but Open AI doesn't have the money.

nfota4u,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Where does the massive Nvidia-OpenAI deal leave Microsoft?,"Doesn’t really impact Microsoft. Microsoft is so overwhelmed with demand they’re leasing capacity from neoclouds.

The way I see it: Nvidia is trying to prolong the capex cycle and bid up the hyperscalers. They have more money than they can spend so might as well support the hyperscaler that doesn’t care about making a profit right now and is committed to spending as much as possible to achieve ASI. Now, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, xAI, etc are going to feel the heat and look to spend even more to remain competitive. Of course most of the spend will go to Nvidia.

Broadcom sold off on the news but Open AI has already committed to them. It’s normal for hyperscalers use both custom and merchant silicon (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, ByteDance already do it). 

Another benefit for Nvidia is they get to benefit from the upside in their new equity in Open AI. So you’re getting more GPU orders, bidding up your customers, and get equity upside.

It’s hard to keep up with tech given the major news every day but despite all the crazy spending, I think we have enough evidence the AI capex build out will continue until at least the end of the decade.

nfohym7,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Where does the massive Nvidia-OpenAI deal leave Microsoft?,"Correct like today Nvidia announced 100B investment into OpenAI, OpenAI wants to give Oracle 100B a year going forward for new compute. That new compute is Nvidia. So the cycle just spins. It is a bit different though then Nvidia's 5B into Intel. That was more along the lines of they can't let AMD win the x86 market and also they have been working on specific server tools together and Intel is really hurting. Long term Nvidia pulled a Microsoft when they saved Apple.

Two different types of Nvidia investment, one is to keep their flywheel going with Software consumes hardware which consumes datacenter/power which then needs to have Nvidia chips in them to keep the cycle going.

I know you didnt mention Intel but in this case the 5B goes towards the custom server products because they realized Grace (ARM) was not condusive for the workloads and existing software stacks so they dont AMD to dominate x86 (even though they have the 64bit patents) is starting to run away with Epyc and so Nvidia wants to pump money back into Xeon so they have a good alternative.... last thing they want is Epyc + MI400X to start to gain traction vs even Epyc + Blackwell/Vera Rubin.

nfo42w0,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Nvidia will Invest up to $100 Billion in OpenAI,"A 5% success rate for projects focused entirely around a years-young technology isn’t as bad as you think it is. 95% of tech projects and startups in general are terrible ideas in reality and maybe 1% actually experience lasting, scaling success.

Besides that, the success rate of startups/projects isn’t actually the main indicator of the value of GenAI, it’s the rate of adoption of it by the individuals that make up the enterprise. That’s where the revolution is occurring, within the workplace. 

Research and market surveys are showing that GenAI adoption and integration is still accelerating and is showing fantastic ROI in ways that will not immediately show up on income statements and balance sheets. 

Enterprise projects to convert unstructured data, in both archived and real-time environments, are where the value is. The amount of untouched information that lives in corporate warehouses is staggering. There aren’t enough employees in the world, offshore or otherwise, to consume, digest, analyze and restructure it into useful information.

I’m talking about the yottabytes of image/video/audio data that enterprise either sit on or throw away. I’m talking about the thousands of human made/edited PDFs and documents that every single corporation has that requires teams of people to sift and extract information from.


TLDR:

These same corporations receive thousands of hours of audio/video data and images all the time that they can now hand to ChatGPT for pennies and extract information from without having to pay millions for an ML/DS dept. to train  highly specialized computer vision models for.

This is why Jensen says that “world AI” is the future.

1nnvw71,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Thoughts on JCI,"Looking at where hyperscaler contracts might land (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google). Has anyone thought about JCI (Johnson Controls)?

Cooling is a big deal.

Data centres are running hotter than ever because of AI and higher density racks. NVIDIA just reported a partnership with OpenAI to build 10 gigawatts of AI data centres using NVIDIA chips. That’s a lot of energy and a lot of heat generated.

Old school air cooling ain’t cutting it. I see that JCI’s offering Silent Aire coolant distribution units that scale from half a megawatt to 10mw+. That’s tailor made for hyperscalers building AI farms. They’ve announced a long term partnership with Tabreed (a giant district cooling company in the Middle East) to push for next gen cooling. 

JCI’s reach is bigger than people realize too.

NA: their biggest unit is lead by Julie Brandt, who just got a special RSU retention package because the board doesn’t want her going anywhere. Instead she’ll be leading the biggest growth market until 2027.

EU: strong in chilled water, smart building retrofits, and compliance heavy ESG projects. Hyperscalers love this because EU regulators are strict on efficiency.

APAC: Silent Aire has hubs in China, Singapore, India, and Australia. They’re selling chillers for crazy hot climates. Again, perfect for AI data centers.

Bottom line.

JCI might not be as flashy as NVIDIA or AMD but someone has to keep those AI racks cool.

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

most of the sales growth has been because of investment, not because of products for end users.

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further.

nfefcrw,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","You need to upgrade your valuation skills and start questioning your judgment. You're assuming they will win in AI, autonomous driving and a bunch of other stuff. You're only looking at revenue instead of free cash flow. 

Run the math on that: Nebius need to build the DCs (which costs a lot of money) before they can collect some of the $20bn Microsoft seems to have committed to them over multiple years (please also note it is unclear how firm this commitment from Microsoft is). So let's just even assume they get a 15-25% FCF conversion on this number that's $3-5bn FCF over the next few years.

Does it warrant a +$10bn jump in market cap? Maybe if that's the first of many contracts and they can secure another three of these, then that would add up to $10-15bn FCF over the next few years, which discounted would warrant that jump. And they are not the only player in town (Coreweave is just another example). And that may be the only contract they ever win. 

The share price can go higher but this stuff is basically a roller-coaster (Coreweave went from $40 to $185 now at $125 in less than 6 months) and it would only take a shift in one of the key assumptions the market needs to make for this to hit the fan. 

Can it go to $50bn market cap? Yes. $100bn? Maybe. But what assumptions do you need to make in your model for that?

Also, I never said NBIS solely focused on data centers, I just said I have experience covering the data center sector as a whole and why I’m skeptical of these huge deals where the buildouts are so capex heavy and the hyperscalers have so much pricing power.",jokull1234,7,,,2025-09-21 01:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/nfbybzq/

It is also not true they will fund capex just through revenue. A few days after the Microsoft announcement they did an equity offering. They also have $1b in convertible bonds on their balance sheet. I’m sure they’re also going to borrow against their higher stock price for more money. They will have to continue doing this until their revenues eventually exceed expenses.

nfbtz0t,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","Its capital intensive business indeed but that Capex will be coming from future revenues, once these start rolling in. Even the debt they incurred is at incredibly favourable rates due to conversion feature, which of course results in dilution but that is not really a huge dilution. For those saying it will not be profitable its mainly because of depreciation as company guide to ADJ EBITDA profitability this quarter. If EPS is skewed downwards bcz of depreciation its not a big deal as Dep is only an accounting cost (not economic cost impacting cash flows). Them being EBITDA profitable means Cash Flow possitive even without MSFT deal and that MSFT deals is a lifeline that funds their future Capex.

nf9uff2,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","I hold a decent NBIS position and am bullish. However it’s not free money and can easily pull back. They aren’t profitable and won’t be anytime soon (eg 5 years). The neocloud business is a blood bath. You need to raise tons of money through debt and stock dilution to fund GPU purchases, data center construction and maintenance, etc. 

The money Microsoft is committing is not prepaid. Nebius has to setup the capacity first and then integrate Microsoft before they see the first cheque.

My guess is it’s going to cost Nebius around $15B to earn the $19B from Microsoft ($4B margin over 5 or so years). It’s tiny money. Of course, Nebius will be able to sell its capacity to other partners as well.

The key thing to keep in mind is Nebius will have to continue diluting shareholders and raise debt/convertible bonds to deliver their operations. 

This thing will be super volatile and can swing 10% from one day to the next but given enormous cloud demand I expect it to 3-10x within the next 5 years.

Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

nf9a50t,comment,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Huge Micron Bet,"That was initially my thought

But If forward EPS is pushed to $10-12 for FY 2026 and forward PE is 20x there is a bull case for price per share to be $200+ 

Current forward PE was 28x at $5.50 per share (dropped to 24-25x now) but if Q4 beat expectation and present a $8 TTM EPS which seems likely for FY2026 at current multiples = ~$200 price per share valuation. 

If forward guidance is good and they can present potential for $10-12 EPS for FY 2026 and Forward PE drops to 18-20x which is on par with competitors (still a premium) there is still a case for $200 per share in 2026. 

I am bullish mainly because Nvidia, AMD, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all had record years and they have Micron in their GPUS for their data centers. If their customers had record years surely Micron has crazy numbers to share? Thats my thought train.

1nm0a5q,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise.

1nlw2gj,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,How do you handle it when you’ve got a hot stock? OKLO,"I’m particularly interested in hearing from longtime investors who have been through this before- 

Let’s say one of your holdings is doing really well, like skyrocketing. But of course, you know it can just as easily drop at the same rate. 

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA. 

Link to OKLO’s site https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

nevh16g,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,How long can the AI stock boom last,"> quite a ways above the historical average for these companies.

This notion that a P/E ratio of 20 is 'normal' and accepted came about when the US was a manufacturing-centric country with a somewhat isolationist foreign policy. 

Those rules do not apply to the forecast of companies like Google, which are advancing and disseminating technology globally at an alarming rate. 

Look at earnings reports. Read the transcripts. It's all about expansion globally and then emerging markets. MSFT is opening data centers in South America, South Africa, Kenya, and Europe. OpenAI just announced a DC push in the UK and India, but they still can't meet capacity stateside.

Read the latest transcript from Pinterest earnings. Although far lower $/user in the 'rest of the world' category (so not US or EU) they grew users by something like 70% yoy (vs I think 11% in the US).

While companies can certainly be overvalued and have a unrealistic P/E...using the 20th century as a benchmark is no longer viable. They (tech companies) hardly dipped their toe into half the developed world. And emerging markets are just being tested now.

1njurb9,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

neqayoh,comment,france,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,IA et Emploi : Dépasser l'optimisme technologique et commencer à préparer la transition dès maintenant - Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle,"Les secteurs les plus vulnérables combinent trois caractéristiques pénalisantes : un fort potentiel de gains de productivité grâce à l’IA, un marché mature ou déclinant, et la possibilité de réinternalisation de certaines activités directement par leurs clients, entreprises ou particuliers, rendue possible par l’IA. 

[Un rapport récent du MIT](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) éclaire ce phénomène : Les organisations les plus performantes en termes de déploiement de l’IA, réduisent significativement leurs dépenses de services externalisés, notamment pour toutes les activités de “back-office”). Il est d’ailleurs intéressant de noter que pour ces acteurs, **ces réductions de coûts viennent en plus de réductions d’effectifs déjà opérées** sur des fonctions comme le support client, le développement logiciel et les fonctions administratives. 

Le secteur des « Activités spécialisées, scientifiques et techniques », qui inclut notamment les cabinets de conseil, les études de marché ou les services professionnels spécialisés, illustre parfaitement cette évolution « asymétrique » entre productivité et demande, et les activités traditionnelles des cabinets de conseil sont  un cas d'école :

* Avec des outils comme ChatGPT, Gemini ou Claude capables de générer des analyses, des études de marché, des plans ou des recommandations stratégiques, les entreprises peuvent désormais produire en interne une partie de ce qu'elles achetaient auparavant à prix d'or. 

* Ainsi même si la productivité dans les cabinets de conseil augmente grâce à l’IA, la demande, elle, n’augmentera pas. Elle devrait même diminuer pour les activités les plus faciles à ré-internaliser dans les entreprises clientes, provoquant une contraction plutôt qu’une croissance du marché pour les activités concernées. ",lhrivsax,1,,,2025-09-17 18:31:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1njhtof/ia_et_emploi_dépasser_loptimisme_technologique_et/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1njhtof/ia_et_emploi_dépasser_loptimisme_technologique_et/neqayoh/
neqasr3,comment,france,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,IA et Emploi : Dépasser l'optimisme technologique et commencer à préparer la transition dès maintenant - Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle,"# III. Une disruption sans précédent par son ampleur et sa vitesse

Pour saisir l’ampleur réelle de cette transformation, nous avons analysé en détail plus de 200 combinaisons entre des secteurs (exemples : industrie manufacturière, construction, services etc. selon la [nomenclature NACE Rev. 2.1](https://showvoc.op.europa.eu/#/datasets/ESTAT_Statistical_Classification_of_Economic_Activities_in_the_European_Community_Rev._2.1._%28NACE_2.1%29/data)) et des activités au sein de l’entreprise (ventes, production, administration etc.). L’objectif : comprendre le rapport entre augmentation de productivité grâce à l’IA, évolution du marché (croissance, stabilité ou décroissance), et impact sur l’emploi. 

**Notre analyse révèle une réalité préoccupante :**

* **Une grande partie des activités internes de l’entreprise connaîtra des gains de productivité significatifs grâce à l'IA**, **et ce dans la plupart des secteurs.** Parmi les activités les plus impactées figurent l’administration, les technologies de l’information (IT), la relation client, ou encore le marketing et la communication.

* **L’augmentation de la production en réaction à ces gains de productivité ne concernera qu’une minorité de secteurs.** Associée à une croissance du marché concerné, elle permettrait effectivement de sauvegarder voire de créer de nouveaux emplois à une échelle significative. Mais il s’agit ici des secteurs déjà en croissance, ou avec un potentiel de croissance inexploité “déblocable grâce à l’IA”. On peut citer les technologies de l’information et de la communication, la santé humaine, les transports et l'entreposage (en lien avec la croissance soutenue du commerce en ligne qui profite à l’ensemble des métiers logistiques). 

* **Même dans ces secteurs en croissance ou à fort potentiel, toutes les activités ou fonctions ne seront pas concernées par des créations d’emploi** associées à l’augmentation de la production. En effet, on peut s’attendre à ce que certaines activités internes touchées par des gains de productivité grâce à l’IA subissent même des destructions nettes d’emplois, comme c’est déjà le cas chez Microsoft, Meta, Google ou SalesForce ([13](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/tech-layoffs-2025-list/), [14](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/white-collar-jobs-most-at-risk-from-ai-in-2025), [15](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html)). 

**Les autres secteurs subiront une destruction nette d'emplois.** Ce sont les secteurs sur des marchés déjà matures, à croissance stable, voire déclinants, sans potentiel significatif associé au déploiement de l’IA.",lhrivsax,1,,,2025-09-17 18:30:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1njhtof/ia_et_emploi_dépasser_loptimisme_technologique_et/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1njhtof/ia_et_emploi_dépasser_loptimisme_technologique_et/neqasr3/

Ses prédictions d'une transformation radicale du marché du travail, où la moitié des emplois « juniors » pourraient disparaître et où le taux chômage pourrait atteindre 20% dans les 5 prochaines années. En particulier l’expression qu’il a utilisée, « a white-collar bloodbath » (bain de sang pour les cols blancs, NDLR), a suscité et suscite encore aujourd'hui de nombreuses réactions, souvent polarisées entre techno-optimistes et techno-pessimistes ([1](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-cut-entry-level-law-finance-consulting-jobs-2025-9))

Ces réactions se sont souvent focalisées sur un argument rassurant : les gains de productivité permettront aux entreprises de produire davantage, sauvegardant ainsi les emplois existants, et créant même de nouveaux emplois globalement.

Cette vision, largement reprise par les acteurs technologiques ainsi que certains politiques et économistes de premier plan, mérite pourtant d’être questionnée. 

De nombreux éléments tangibles indiquent en effet que ce n’est pas ce qu’il va se passer, que ce postulat est au mieux optimiste (voire utopiste) et qu’il est vital de commencer dès aujourd’hui à anticiper des disruptions majeures sur le marché de l’emploi dans la décennie à venir et de préparer la transition dans les nombreux secteurs d’activités concernés. ",lhrivsax,1,,,2025-09-17 18:29:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1njhtof/ia_et_emploi_dépasser_loptimisme_technologique_et/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1njhtof/ia_et_emploi_dépasser_loptimisme_technologique_et/neqakqn/
1njhtof,post,france,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,IA et Emploi : Dépasser l'optimisme technologique et commencer à préparer la transition dès maintenant - Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle,"Je vous partage ici le résumé d'une note d'analyse publiée par l'OIA, petit think tank français indépendant. Je trouve leur analyse pertinente et bien expliquée.

Et accessoirement même si ça commence à progresser dans le bon sens, je trouve ça dommage que le discours dominant soit encore que l'IA va simplement créer des emplois.

Et l'idée n'est pas d'être alarmiste ou de dire que ça va être l'apocalypse, mais simplement d'accepter que l'IA va avoir un impact important sur le travail en général et qu'on devrait essayer d'anticiper un peu.

Mais bon c'est sûr que c'est un problème de plus à gérer, dans un contexte déjà pas simple où les gens n'ont déjà pas assez d'espace mental pour les sujets courants comme ""changer de gouvernement""...

En tout cas c'est bien qu'il y ait des gens qui fassent ce travail d'analyse et d'explication.

Voici un résumé, je mets le lien vers le PDF en bas de page et le texte complet en commentaire :

**Source :** Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle, Septembre 2025

# I. Contexte

* L'interview de Dario Amodei (CEO d'Anthropic) en janvier 2025 a relancé le débat sur l'impact de l'IA sur l'emploi avec ses prédictions alarmantes (moitié des emplois ""juniors"" pourraient disparaître, taux de chômage de 20% possible dans les 5 prochaines années, expression ""white-collar bloodbath"")
* Les réactions se focalisent souvent sur un argument rassurant : les gains de productivité permettront aux entreprises de produire davantage, sauvegardant les emplois existants et créant de nouveaux emplois
* Cette vision optimiste, largement reprise par les acteurs technologiques et certains dirigeants politiques/économiques, mérite d'être questionnée
* De nombreux éléments tangibles indiquent que ce postulat est au mieux optimiste, au pire utopiste, et qu'il est vital d'anticiper dès maintenant les disruptions majeures sur le marché de l'emploi

# II. Un scénario optimiste reposant sur deux hypothèses clés

# Première hypothèse (cohérente selon l'analyse) :

* L'IA générative permettra des gains de productivité significatifs, notamment pour les activités de ""production intellectuelle""
* Ce postulat fait largement consensus dans les milieux économiques
* Il ne s'agit généralement pas d'automatisation complète mais plutôt d'augmentation des travailleurs (""human in the loop"")
* Les travailleurs augmentés par l'IA remplacent les travailleurs sans IA, mais l'humain reste ""dans la boucle""
* Face aux gains de productivité, une entreprise peut choisir soit d'augmenter sa production, soit de réduire ses coûts à production équivalente

# Seconde hypothèse (largement fallacieuse selon l'analyse) :

* Les gains de productivité constituent un facteur de croissance du marché, provoquant une augmentation de la production plutôt qu'une réduction des coûts
* Cette hypothèse n'est valable que dans deux cas :
   * **Cas 1** : Secteur en croissance stable avec potentiel pleinement exploité - les gains de productivité permettent de répondre à la croissance sans embaucher
   * **Cas 2** : Secteur avec potentiel inexploité - les gains permettent de ""débloquer"" ce potentiel via réduction des prix
* **Problème majeur** : Dans les secteurs sans croissance ni potentiel inexploité, l'augmentation de productivité ne s'accompagne d'aucune croissance du marché - parfois même d'une décroissance
* Cette asymétrie entre gains de productivité et évolution de la production constitue un défi économique et social majeur de la révolution IA

# III. Une disruption sans précédent par son ampleur et sa vitesse

# Analyse de plus de 200 combinaisons secteurs/activités :

* **Objectif** : Comprendre le rapport entre augmentation de productivité grâce à l'IA, évolution du marché et impact sur l'emploi

# Résultats préoccupants :

# Activités fortement impactées par les gains de productivité :

* Administration, technologies de l'information (IT), relation client, marketing et communication
* Ces gains concernent une grande partie des activités internes dans la plupart des secteurs

# Secteurs avec augmentation de production compensatrice (minorité) :

* Technologies de l'information et communication, santé humaine, transports et entreposage
* Secteurs déjà en croissance ou avec potentiel ""déblocable grâce à l'IA""
* Même dans ces secteurs favorables, toutes les fonctions ne bénéficient pas de créations d'emploi
* Certaines activités subissent même des destructions nettes (cas déjà observé chez Microsoft, Meta, Google, SalesForce)

# Secteurs subissant une destruction nette d'emplois :

* Secteurs sur marchés matures, à croissance stable ou déclinants, sans potentiel significatif lié à l'IA

# Secteurs les plus vulnérables - Trois caractéristiques pénalisantes :

* Fort potentiel de gains de productivité grâce à l'IA
* Marché mature ou déclinant
* Possibilité de réinternalisation par les clients (entreprises/particuliers) rendue possible par l'IA

# Exemples concrets de secteurs à risque :

# ""Activités spécialisées, scientifiques et techniques"" (cabinets de conseil) :

* Avec ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude : les entreprises peuvent produire en interne analyses, études de marché, plans stratégiques
* Même si la productivité augmente dans les cabinets, la demande diminue par réinternalisation
* Provoque une contraction plutôt qu'une croissance du marché

# Services administratifs et fonctions support :

* ""Double impact"" : gains de productivité chez les clients + réinternalisation des activités sous-traitées
* Les fournisseurs de services touchés par réductions d'effectifs dues à la baisse d'activité

# Secteur financier et d'assurance :

* Marché mature avec gains significatifs mais aucune croissance compensatrice
* Impact sur comptabilité, analyses financières, service clients

# Secteur juridique :

* Quand l'IA peut fournir un conseil juridique de qualité, réduction de la demande pour cas standards
* Concentration sur les cas complexes nécessitant expertise humaine

# IV. Dynamiques systémiques amplificatrices

# Impact sur les postes d'entrée :

* Les postes ""juniors"" pénalisés en premier - ceux qui permettent aux jeunes d'acquérir l'expérience
* Paradoxe : les profils juniors, plus à l'aise avec l'IA, voient leurs opportunités se réduire
* Interruption de la transmission des compétences métiers, questionnant la formation des futures générations d'experts

# Autres facteurs systémiques :

* Plafonds de croissance méconnus dans les secteurs supposés compensateurs (contraintes ressources, énergie, infrastructures)
* Concentration des bénéfices entre les mains des détenteurs de capital technique
* Diminution du poids économique des travailleurs dans les négociations

# V. ""The elephant in the room"" : La transition dont personne ne parle

# Paradoxe majeur :

* Malgré l'évidence de la disruption, aucun acteur ne prépare réellement la transition
* Absence de préparation stratégique au niveau des entreprises ET des institutions

# Au niveau des entreprises :

* Plus de 80% des dirigeants tech anticipent une réduction des embauches dans les 24 mois, mais sans plan d'accompagnement structuré
* Même les dirigeants les plus avancés admettent ne pas avoir de consensus sur les niveaux d'embauche 3-5 ans

# Au niveau institutionnel - Cas du plan français ""Osez l'IA"" :

* Budget de 200 millions d'euros pour accélérer l'adoption de l'IA (objectif 100% grands groupes d'ici 2030)
* **Aucune ligne du programme ne traite de l'anticipation/accompagnement des travailleurs impactés**
* Illustration parfaite du déni : financer l'accélération de la cause sans tenir compte des conséquences
* Contraste avec le rapport de la Commission IA (mars 2024) qui citait déjà la nécessité de ""se préparer à la disparition de certains métiers""

# Inadéquation des mécanismes existants :

* Les dispositifs (formation, reconversion, soutien chômage) sont calibrés pour des transitions sectorielles graduelles
* L'IA va impacter simultanément de nombreux secteurs et fonctions, à grande échelle et sur période courte (probablement d'ici 2030)
* L'histoire économique montre que les transitions mal anticipées génèrent des crises durables

# VI. Recommandations pour une transition maîtrisée

# Principe directeur :

* Abandonner l'illusion d'une transition automatiquement bénéfique
* Adopter une approche pragmatique et proactive de gestion des risques

# Pour les décideurs politiques :

* **Abandonner le mythe de compensation automatique** et planifier une économie post-productivité avec nouveaux indicateurs (au-delà du PIB, incluant transition et impact social/environnemental)
* **Expérimenter des mécanismes de réallocation** des gains de productivité via système alimenté par les entreprises bénéficiaires
* **Créer des ""zones de transition protégées""** où l'automatisation est maîtrisée (secteurs stratégiques, métiers artisanaux, savoir-faire irréversible)
* **Investir massivement** dans les secteurs créateurs nets identifiés avec conditions d'accès favorables pour travailleurs déplacés
* **Anticiper les risques de ""dumping social""** et coordination internationale
* **Identifier secteurs prioritaires** propres à la France et programme de réindustrialisation
* **Dispositifs d'utilité publique** pour les citoyens, particulièrement les jeunes

# Pour les entreprises :

* **Maintenir le ""human in the loop""** en privilégiant augmentation plutôt qu'automatisation
* **Anticiper effets de réinternalisation** sur écosystème de fournisseurs avec démarche transparente/responsable
* **Développer stratégies de différenciation par l'humain** (créativité, empathie, relationnel)
* **Dispositifs d'accompagnement** aux risques psychosociaux

# Pour les travailleurs :

* **Privilégier secteurs/fonctions favorables** à l'emploi avec dispositifs publics renforcés
* **Développer compétences complémentaires** plutôt que substituables (que l'IA ne peut reproduire)
* **Préparation psychologique** à nouvelle relation au travail (volatilité, résilience, adaptabilité)

# Pour la société civile :

* **Questionner le modèle économique** de transformation des gains et pousser vers modèles alternatifs de répartition
* **Exiger transparence et participation** dans les décisions impactant massivement l'emploi
* **Repenser la valeur du travail humain** au-delà de la productivité économique
* **Créer des observatoires citoyens locaux** de l'impact IA sur l'emploi

# VII. Conclusion

# Réalité de la transformation :

* La révolution IA ne suivra pas les schémas rassurants des transformations passées
* **Asymétrie fondamentale** : gains de productivité massifs et rapides vs croissance ""compensatrice"" limitée à une minorité de secteurs
* Facteurs aggravants : réinternalisation d'activités, impact disproportionné sur postes juniors
* Transition plus complexe que ne le suggère le discours dominant

# Urgence d'action :

* Plus question de débattre de l'opportunité (transformation déjà en cours)
* **Construire dès maintenant** les mécanismes pour traverser sans fracture sociale majeure
* Abandonner illusion de transition automatiquement bénéfique
* Approche proactive, transparente et coordonnée entre tous les acteurs
* **Le coût de l'inaction pourrait être bien supérieur à celui de la préparation**
* Saisir la fenêtre d'opportunité pour anticiper plutôt que subir

nep9cs7,comment,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Take profit and reinvest in the same asset?,">For example, if you are up 150% on Microsoft and plan on holding it for another decade, when would it make sense to sell half and lock in those profits, and then start to DCA back in?

I don't get the logic behind this what purpose would it serve ? The only reason to do this is if you want to realize those capital gains when you may be in the 0% tax bracket or something

However there are three outcomes

1. MSFT keeps rising and you buy back less shares as you sold , and DCA back in while the stock kept rising meaning you are missing out on gains, plus generated taxes.
2. MSFT is flat , what means you have done nothing except generate taxes, and unless you are in the 0% tax breacket you end up buying back in less because now you have to pay taxes
3. MSFT declines , this is the only case you might come out ahead , but it would have to decline more then the taxes you generate from selling. Meaning if you generate $1000 of taxes but MSFT only declines slightly and you purchase your shares back  at a $500 discount you still lose.",SirGlass,8,,,2025-09-17 15:24:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/nep9cs7/
1njct2n,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Take profit and reinvest in the same asset?,"Hi investors -
Just taking a quick poll here regarding strategies for locking in gains. Does anyone take profits and then reinvest into the same asset?
For example, if you are up 150% on Microsoft and plan on holding it for another decade, when would it make sense to sell half and lock in those profits, and then start to DCA back in?
Also, I get that this is mostly a math thing. Can anyone help me think about it in terms of the numbers?",mrmses,0,0.25,18.0,2025-09-17 15:13:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/
