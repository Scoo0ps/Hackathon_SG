njxmoxl,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"In the end of course the software is more important and that will depend specifically for your workflow. Some workflows just don't work on mac and that's fine.

That's why I was talking purely hardware and the prices of it. 

Regarding surface, yes, those are basically best windows laptops. The 15 inch surface laptop actually costs 100$ more than latest 15"" Macbook Air. The surface laptop has a chip that is 2 generations behind from Apple, is heavier by 150 grams, thicker, has worse screen, worse trackpad and way worse thermals. The only thing it has over the Air is the 120hz screen and slightly better battery. All while costing 100$ more than the Apple device, yet Apple is the one that is apparently ""super expensive"".",AwkwardWillow5159,1,,,2025-10-17 09:15:45,https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/macbooks/apple-removes-this-critical-accessory-from-european-m5-macbook-pro-boxes-and-i-hope-this-isnt-a-new-norm,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o83rxp/apple_removes_charger_from_european_macbooks/njxmoxl/
njxkkq9,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"Yeah, no one is forcing you to buy an iPhone either? It's a device family with no low tier devices. Of course you don't compare iPhones to 150$ android. It's a different category.

Within the category of higher end phones, Apple is not ""super expensive"".

You can get base iPhone 17 for 950eur, and they do the ""budget"" FE versions, that come at 700eur.

So again, the prices are absolutely comparable.

I mean, there are more brands offering Windows computers out of which many include craploads of bloatware so sure. A fair comparison would be comparing a MacBook with Microsofts own laptops... But at the end of the day it's all about what you're gonna use your laptop for and what applications you need. 

When I was doing research I had a MacBook, and it was impossible to upgrade the OS because every time we did, all applications would break. That's just annoying af.

1o8oydh,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Can Brokerages Share/Sell Your Trading Data?,"Hi all,
my apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.

I've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since. Over the last ~6 years I've regularly bought SPY & VTI, and some AAPL, GOOGL, AMD, MSFT, NET, companies i am passionate about and follow intently. 

last week, i transfered some cash into my trading account and decided to disperse it evenly amongst SPY, VTI, and SCHD. Ever since, my Google News feed has been sharing nonstop reports about SCHD from websites like Seeking Alpha, Tipranks, etc... everyday, front and center in the ""For You"" panel. 

I am 100% certain i have done nothing to search, research, talk, text, or do anything inbetween to discuss this beyond just clicking the ""order"" button in the Schwab app once.

njvypm8,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"It really isn’t, for the most part. But people repeat it enough where everyone thinks that i guess.

They have a few expensive offerings, like their monitors for 5k, but it’s more of professional/business expense.

If you actually compare their devices to same tier of other manufacture, Apple is within 20% price of their competitor. The skew is higher for lower end devices, but lowers for high end devices. So Apple entry level is higher.

But S25 Ultra is 1250 eur while iPhone Pro Max is 1300 eur. 

That’s not super expensive. It’s same thing.

Then Samsung has higher tier option for the Fold series that Apple doesn’t even offer, you can get those folds for 2200 eur.

Same with MacBooks. Sure the entry level is expensive, but that’s because they dont compete in the low/mid tier range. If you compare MacBooks to high end laptops, prices again are very similar. And usually you will get significantly better product from a MacBook than a top tier windows laptop, I tried. No matter how much money you throw at a windows laptop, majority of them still will completely suck.

njvjm8l,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"You're missing a few key details here. 

Apple did lower the price in the EU and even if you add the 65€ charger, the total is still a bit lower than last year's M4 model. That's not a ""rip-off"" it's literally what EU regulators asked for. Unbundle the charger so consumers don't have to keep buying the same accessory. Apple followed that to the letter. The 64$ ""overpayment"" isn't Apple greed, it's called VAT and regional pricing. In the US prices are listed without sales tax, while in the EU they're listed with VAT included, which is 19% to 27%. Then you have currency fluctuations, import duties, warranty laws, higher local wages and operating costs so you're always going to pay more here. 

EU customers are finally getting the option regulators wanted with a net lower price and less e-waste.

1o8cw2k,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline (most people are focusing on interest rate cuts, but ignoring this fatal truth)","The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month, but Powell's statement last night is the real bombshell, signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction. Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.

Balance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults. When the Fed sells mortgage bonds, it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings. When it sells Treasury bonds, corporate bond issuance costs also rise. This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity, which requires closer scrutiny. History always repeats itself. On the eve of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn't stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero. Ultimately, it was the initiation of Q1, or reverse balance sheet reduction, that stabilized the financial system. In his speech yesterday, Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets. This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019, when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10%, nearly shutting down Wall Street. He's clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake, and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment. On the surface, the US stock market is still rising, but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants, which together account for over 32% of the S&P 500's weighting. The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium-sized businesses are struggling with financing costs. This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate, but the patient's hands and feet are already cold. Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy. Even more subversive, halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic. When the Fed expands its balance sheet again, it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar. This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash. He didn't rush to cut interest rates back then, but instead directly injected liquidity into the market, successfully stemming the spread of the crisis. Powell's approach is now precisely the same. For businesses, this is an even more life-or-death situation. The Treasury Department issues $1 trillion in bonds every quarter. If the Fed stops selling them, it effectively lowers the government's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, giants like Apple and Microsoft, with $800 billion in cash on hand, will be in for a rude awakening. Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash, and the money they hold is quietly evaporating. So, when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts, remember the deeper meaning behind Powell's move, as quoted by Dave Reifsner, Director of Research at the Federal Reserve.

A famous governance maxim: When interest rates hit rock bottom, the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon. This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game. Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight; halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall. This move today will undoubtedly upset some. But it must be said. In the financial world, the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay.

Why would they put a massive RJ45 receptacle, which doesn't even fit on even the thickest MacBook Pro? I'm familiar with your use case.  That's what the several 40 (soon to be 80) Gbps Thunderbolt ports are there for. If you use your Apple laptop on a desktop setup, you'll have all video, peripherals, Ethernet, etc. routed through a Thunderbolt hub. In my case, I have a monitor that takes an Ethernet cable, has all keyboards, mice, video, audio etc. attached and all I need is _one_ Thunderbolt cable to the Macbook, and it delivers all of the aforementioned, plus power.
  
And people are joking here about Apple obsolescence, when they support old smartphones with security updates for something like a decade.

In addition many many people will not be educated enough to be able to select a good replacement. Will your dad or grandma or little sister be able to select a cheaper safe option? For many people it’s a simpler choice to go with a known brand than to go with an unknown brand.

Also, if you are buying apple products you are more likely to have higher disposable income, which makes the cost less of an issue. For me in Ireland that’s not even half of my daily wage.

njs7ity,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"The EU directive to minimize e-waste was supposed to make companies offer products optionally without chargers, in case they already have one.

- Old price (MBP M4): 1930 EUR (with charger)

So we are currently at a net profit, but at the same time the dollar has grown weaker, so it’s hard to pinpoint if Apple is ripping us off.

EDIT: I just made some math…

Using NL tax (21%), since these prices I got from NL Apple Store, what we have is:

- After taxes: 1830 EUR
- Before taxes: 1512 EUR (1830/1,21) = 1764 USD

When I bought my first Apple Macbook with USB-C in 2016, I bought a secondary 87W USB-C charger.

Also my dock that I use nowadays can charge with 90W. So I basically have more than enough chargers. If I buy new macbook and it came with a charger I would just thorw that charger to the other unused chargers.

I know that other people circumstances might be very different and they always sold/gave away the charger that came with older devices. But I think with USB-C it is no longer needed to consider charger and device as pair. It also allows competition for chargers. And a lot of chargers are cheaper than Apple's offering.

However this is not an issue because Amazon is a growth company for one. Apple is not. They are stagnant. Apple is a cash cow & just ploughs all their funds into buybacks. Short sighted.

Amazon could do exactly the same but prefers to push the envelope. The past 5yrs they have invested $455B more into R&D & capex than Apple...

You also have to factor in that Amazon has used stock for M&A.

They have never released anything particularly innovative. They let other companies release good things, would release a better version of the product. Now they just improve things slightly each year - accountants ahead of design & innovation.

They shrugged off AI with their wait and see process and now things are developing so quickly that they cannot catch up. They also continue to refuse to invest significantly despite having massive cash reserves. 

They abused their dominance and the iOS closed ecosystem is being torn down by regulators.

Ive, the designer behind almost every iconic project left a company he dedicated his life to because Apple became too focused on operations, finance and risk aversion. 

Tim Cook did a good job, particularly around developing supply chains that made the company massively profitable. He should have stepped aside and let someone else take over. Imagine Ive as CEO and Cook moving to COO back in 2019. Creative direction, design and brand identity taking priority with Cook ensuring the cogs continue to run well (the experience that Ive lacks).

Netflix is extremely sticky and the cheapest plan is 8 dollars month. That’s cheaper than a McDonald’s meal now. 

Netflix also has a top tier management team with Ted imo being one of the best ceos out there. 

I’m gonna be biased because I own Netflix but imo Netflix is one of the strongest companies out there. 

They’re subscription based too so their revenue isn’t going to bounce around like these other cyclical companies like Apple or NVIDIA which are hardware companies.

Remember when everyone said it’s over for Netflix and then Netflix said okay live events and advertising and that shut all the Netflix bears up really quick.

If you wanted to say that Apple is weaker due to being a hardware company I think that’s a fair point. But so is NVIDIA. That leaves them both to cyclical industries.

1o7177q,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. 

I also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). 

Their moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.

iPad: $26.69 B
iPhone: $201.18 B
Mac: $29.98 B
Service: $96.17 B
Wearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B

(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment

Doing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  

In the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to.  I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. 

TLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone 

Edit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.  I was going to make this post about Amazon before I looked at the numbers.

njh7wv5,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Yeah, that’s the unquestionable downside. You could also mitigate market risk (though not diversification risk) by putting reinvested amounts into something safe / inversely correlated with tech stocks.

My personal view is that Apple/Nvidia are going to be substantially more volatile than other parts of the market, but will likely perform well over the midterm. I would personally probably tolerate the added risk for sake of tax efficiency, especially if I was in a position of not having to sell if there was a 2-3 year downturn. You could also split the difference some, and do an initial larger sale this year and next year, staying within the 15% fed gains, and do more gradual tax efficient sell down from there. 

Another thought — I’m not sure what you said you were holding in your tax sheltered account, but if a decent amount of it is in an S&P 500 type fund, it has an outsized holding in big tech. You can also diversify by moving some of that into a diversified fund which isn’t highly overweight big tech, which is a completely tax free way to add more sector diversity.

Congratulations on your retirement u/Johnny-Virgil! With nearly half your wealth in two names, your financial future still hinges on company-specific risk. A few strategies to consider:

**Exchange funds** – Contribute appreciated stock (like NVDA or AAPL) into a diversified pool without triggering capital gains. A 7-year hold, but highly effective if you don’t need liquidity soon.

**Gradual diversification** – Dollar cost average out of your stock over time while optimizing tax brackets. Reinvest proceeds in liquid ETFs or a direct indexing portfolio to maintain flexibility.

**Protective hedging** – Use collars to limit downside while retaining some upside potential. Can be used to straddle tax years if you are waiting to drop into a lower tax bracket in 2026.

**\*Tax-aware long/short** – Enhanced version of direct indexing (eg 130/30). Uses margin borrowing and short sales to accelerate loss harvesting, allows you to offset gains from selling your concentrated stocks. \*this one is a bit more aggressive and may not be appropriate for your portfolio and stage in life, but I'm including for general awareness in this thread. Please discuss with your financial advisor.

A blend of two or more of these strategies could provide immediate diversification, continued upside potential, sufficient liquidity, and tax efficiency.

Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.

Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.

They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?

Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.

But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.

So the real question is this:
Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?
Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",TigerMCU,0,0.14,12.0,2025-10-14 06:09:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/

1o63dnv,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Tata Electronics acquires Chinese iPhone supplier Justech’s India unit for about $100 million, sources say","Tata Electronics has acquired Chinese industrial firm Justech Precision’s India unit for close to $100 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, as the Tata Group subsidiary bolsters its manufacturing capacity to benefit from Apple’s focus on iPhone manufacturing in India.

The transaction was concluded in August, with HSBC Bank and HDFC Bank advising on the deal, according to the people close to the deal.

Headquartered in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, China, Justech Precision has been a supplier to Apple since 2008. It provides industrial equipment, such as computer numerical control machines used for precise cutting and fabrication tasks, to Foxconn, the world’s largest assembler of Apple products.

Justech Precision Industry India, incorporated in late 2019 and based in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comments, neither did Tata Group. Tata Electronics declined to comment.

In January, Tata Electronics reportedly bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron’s India operation that operates an iPhone plant, Reuters reported. The deal’s value was not disclosed.

The acquisitions come as Tata Electronics, which began assembling iPhones in India in 2023, seeks to expand its manufacturing capacity as Apple reportedly plans to source all of the iPhones for the U.S. market from India by the end of 2026.

Apple, which still manufacturers most of its smartphones in China, has been taking urgent steps to build capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn, pivoting away from China amid higher tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Foxconn still accounts for two-thirds of India’s total iPhones shipments, with Tata making the remaining one-third, according to Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, who expects that market share could change soon as Tata scales up its manufacturing.

Tata currently operates two plants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which was formerly owned by Wistron.

# Made in India by 2026

Apple started looking for manufacturing alternatives after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown in China disrupted output at its largest assembly plant. The heightened Beijing-Washington tensions and tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the U.S. this year have prompted Apple to accelerate the shift in production.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially slapped prohibitive triple-digit tariffs on imports from China before granting a temporary reprieve for smartphones shipments. Despite India also facing high tariffs from the U.S., iPhones made in India don’t attract any duties as of now. Apple’s shift in production to India instead of the U.S. has angered Trump, who in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years worked to promote India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high-tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development.

But Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengaluru assembling older model iPhones, which saw a labor riot in late 2020.

Apple is looking to build “highly localized” partners to become “truly diversified,” instead of bringing Chinese or Taiwanese partners in India and be dependent on them, Shah said, but finding alternatives for components sourced primarily from Chinese suppliers could take years.

“It will not be a sprint to build like-for-like supplier ecosystem as it enjoyed in China, but a marathon and a step by step process,” Shah added.

India will account for around 26% of global iPhone shipments by the end of 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year, according to the latest estimate by Counterpoint.

Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Justech’s innovation exhibition center in Jiangsu during his trip to China in March where he pledged to continue to make large-scale investment in the country.

You could do it year by year slowing moving it from single stocks to direct index s&p.  

That will give you the diversity you need, at a small cost (say .1-.4) and also help offset the gains from selling with some tax loss harvesting moving forward. 


But you would need to be prepared to unwind it yourself or pay the fee forever.   You can exclude apple and nvda from the index also until it balances out.

njd96kl,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"If you are living comfortably from other income, I would de-risk slowly over time and minimize cap gain exposure.  Annual federal capital gains tax of 0 for married taxable income under @ $100k. Not sure if you itemize, but lets say your taxable income now is under $35k after deductions. You could then sell roughly $65k without capital gains annually (with the actual sale of stock being more depending on your basis and how much of your holdings is gains). Then you could DCA that into a more diversified portfolio, VOO with some core bond fund with whatever split you’re comfortable with. 

Yes, you’ll carry some non diversification risk and added volatility, but neither Apple nor Nvidia are going anywhere and they’ve already returned very well for you. If there is a downturn, you aren’t in a position of having to sell into weakness and you’ll become more and more diversified as you do the stepped sales over time while maximizing tax efficiency.",Mistakesweremade1974,2,,,2025-10-14 02:30:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njd96kl/
njcgsw7,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,This is definitely a possibility unfortunately. But it’s probably the easiest way to keep partial positions in NVDA and AAPL while having some sort of safety net. You could also simultaneously set up alerts on your phone in the event the stock drops x%. If your stop loss is below that then you’d at least be alerted and if it’s a vertical drop you could try and sell or cancel your stop loss order. Unfortunately hard to automate that and would have to be manually done.,pupulewailua,2,,,2025-10-13 23:45:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njcgsw7/

njb65hx,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"I’m in a similar situation. Heavy tech due to RSUs. I am selling as much former employer stock as I can without jacking my long term capital gains taxes through the roof. You’ll have to pick your number, 15%, 18.8% or 23.8% and fill out that tax bracket. For me, it is 18.8 but sometimes I think this is going to take too long and my efforts will be eclipsed my market gains. Do take a look at state tax treatment for LTCG. Here in California, the state tax bracket is 9.3% out to nearly $700k, which is around the start of the 23.8% federal bracket, but if I push harder, not only will I get 5% extra federal, but another 4% California tax lumped on for a total of 37.1%, plus some extra bonus millionaire assessments to support mental health and such. 

NVIIDA has way, way more exposure to AI than Apple, so I’d start there. Apple won’t be immune because it is in the same ETFs with the AI majors, but should bounce eventually when sanity returns. NVIDIA just needs some competition or a large pullback in spending and it is sunk, a shadow of itself and will stay that way for a while, probably through the next crash, or so I believe. That said, long term, Apple needs to recommit to engineering or suffer decline.

If you are holding some losers - tough in this market -  then you can sell those too and use those losses to cancel some of the gains for tax purposes. See Tax Loss Harvesting.

Your broker is probably also running a stock exchange program. They take your stock and a bunch of other investors stock, toss it together into a mini-fund, make you wait 7 years for tax magic to occur, then you get back a bunch of stock from the other companies in the fund, and a little of your own. This will not spark capital gains tax (yet) but at the end of the day, you will be left holding a pile of different single stocks rather than just NVidia. What is this pile of tripe they give you? Well it is all the stuff that other people had too much of and didn’t want — GE! Yay! — but at least you are diversified some.  There is a big difference between this and an actual ETF, which can trade in kind with every stock in the market and keep itself current. You are still owning a bunch of single stocks which over the decades will one by one go dark due to age and mismanagement with no tax efficient way to replace them with new stuff. The 7 year lock in may problem too. It might make sense if your tax bracket is sky high near term and you need to sleep at night.",RedditIsAWeenie,3,,,2025-10-13 19:52:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njb65hx/

njaijpr,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Missing some key variables, here. Depends on how much you have elsewhere. Is it just the IRAs? You don't say how old you are, I'll assume 58 (where we retired). You also don't say if you're single or MFJ.

Why are you paying a FA to do the IRA and not the whole thing?  Does he give advice on how to handle the funds he doesn't handle? If not, you're just throwing money away - that's exactly what you need help with.

Assuming you have about the same in other retirement funds, and that those will also be taxed as you take distributions, you should (have) retire(d) early enough to start spending down the AAPL and NVDA aggressively for a few years.  Certainly book LTCG all the way up to the top of your 0% bracket, but you've got a lot so you probably ought to book some at 15% LTCG too.  For MFJ, the 0% caps out at around 130k with std. deduction, but remember that's your AGI, so any pension or dividend or interest coming in will eat into that. (EDIT: I had 230k, it's 130k)

Now that you are retired with a valuable portfolio you are out of the wealth accumulation phase and are entering the capital preservation and income generation phase. So am I. You should move from concentration to diversification. Half of your money in just two stocks is too concentrated. You need to diversify.

Your reluctance to pay long term capital gains tax seems to be inhibiting you. Don’t let it. If you are married filing jointly and your taxable income (after deductions) is below $96,700 your long term capital gains tax rate is 0%. Zero percent. If it is above that but below $496,600 the tax rate is 15%. Start selling shares, starting with your highest cost shares. Use the money to diversify into broad index funds, including foreign stock indexes. Keep selling NVDA and AAPL until each is 5% of your portfolio. Consider buying dividend focused ETFs including foreign dividend payers. I’m projected to collect over $70k in dividends over the next 12 months. The tax rates and tax brackets for qualified dividends are the same as for long term capital gains. I also have significant positions in physical gold and silver, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks as insurance against a US dollar and US sovereign debt crisis due to out of control deficit spending and unsustainable costs of servicing the ballooning national debt.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-10-17.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",intraalpha,42,0.89,1.0,2025-10-13 16:05:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/

Bring in income and if it gets called, so what, other than taxes.

nj9htl4,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Look there are a couple options.

There are some more recent papers that say that 100% equity portfolios aren’t inferior to a more stock or bond portfolio as long as you’re at at 4% withdrawal rate. 

That being said I agree with you on the tech bubble. I don’t know when but we are probably gonna have a pop sometime and it will probably come with a pretty big market drop and probably a recession. Crashed early in a retirement portfolio life cycle are extra bad compared to later ones.

You didn’t mention in the context of your overall retirement savings what % nvidia is, but it still makes up 7.5% of the sp500 just by itself… so if you are all in on voo 7% of your worth is nvidia. What is your TOTAL exposure to nvidia: personal stocks +7% of sp500 holdings. If it’s more than 20% is definitely trim back to at least that number.

I personally am selling my nvidia this week as well. Partly bc of bubble fears though the other thing concerning me is we’re starting to see a rising number of vendor financing deals between different ai companies and nvidia is part of several of them. Any stumble from any part of the chain will make the whole pyramid collapse even worse than before. To me it’s enough of a shock to my thesis I think I’m going to take my profits. But that’s just me. 

I haven’t seen apple as involved in many of these deals but same logic as far as portfolio % applies.

As far as tax implications that’s a better question for an accountant, but typically you want to sell from tax advantaged accounts first and brokerages last. But that being said, I wouldn’t let the tax tail wag the dog on making smart decisions, jsut make sure you earmark some do the profits for taxes 

Also remeber it’s not all or nothing, you could for example sell 1/2, or 10% a month for thr next 12 months or whatever .

As far as safer places to go I think TIPS bonds are about as safe as it gets if a bit boring. If you want to stay in equities brk b is about as safe as it gets. It might still fall in a bubble but it shouldn’t be as far.",ninjagorilla,8,,,2025-10-13 14:44:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/nj9htl4/
nj9gxtw,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"He did make a lot of changes to the rollover. Some treasuries, bought various buffered ETFs, basically the “three buckets” approach. He said he’s not particularly worried about my individual stocks, because even though they are tech heavy, (apple, Nvidia, Shopify, Netflix) they are good companies and since I don’t need the money right away, he thinks I should let them ride. I’m more worried than he is about locking in some gains. He doesn’t actively manage my personal portfolio, but will give general advice. I  own my house, don’t have much debt, and we live on about 5-6k a month, averaged out with paying school and property taxes, insurance, etc. I talked to a bunch of 1% AUM guys before I settled on him. He seems to be honest and also flat fee, so I felt comfortable with him. I do want to pay someone else look at my currrent set up to make sure it tracks, but that’s like asking one contractor for an opinion on another contractor’s roofing job. You’re gonna hear some differing opinions regardless of how good the job is.",Johnny-Virgil,26,,,2025-10-13 14:38:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/nj9gxtw/
nj9f3i9,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"I would purchase a mix of utilities and financials and collect a 4-5% dividend on that money every year for as long as I could.  There are going to be market fluctuations but long term the sky isn’t falling.  Your investment would be safe in Enbridge, Scotiabank, etc.  i put my 80 year old mother in these stocks with a massive chunk of her retirement fund and I sleep like a baby at night. I would liquidate my nvidia shares at this point if I was retiring, as well.  If there’s a huge monster pullback in the market investing in VOO won’t help you.

1o5hji1,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"I’ve done a bunch of searches on Reddit about people nervous having a large chunk of their portfolio being Nvidia, but most seem to be in the accumulation phase. I have about 2,000 shares of Nvidia and 2,000 shares of Apple that I’ve been holding for years, probably worth close to a million. I would like to move it to something less risky, since I’m getting nervous about an AI correction crushing my gains. My financial advisor manages my IRA but not my personal brokerage account. All of it would be subject to LTCG tax. What would the best thing to do for someone who is newly retired, has some protection against sequence of returns risk via the IRA but is nervous about having close to half of my money tied up in these two stocks?

1o4sjzh,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Week Recap: Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. The stock market tumbled. We've seen this before. Will the rally continue? Oct. 6, 2025 – Oct. 10, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from October 3 to October 10.

Last week, the stock market completed a fully green week, but the gains were limited to around 0.5%. This week had some losing days, but they were still limited expect for Friday. The most important topic of 2025 came out again: Tariffs.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

September 12 close at 6,584.29 - September 19 close at 6,664.39 🟢 (+1.22%)

September 19 close at 6,664.39 - September 26 close at 6,643.70 🔴 (-0.31%)

September 26 close at 6,643.70 - October 3 close at 6,715.79 🟢 (+1.09%)

October 3 close at 6,715.79 - October 10 close at 6,552.50 🔴 (-2.43%)

🔸 Monday: Trump said the stock market continually hit records highs. He's right. Many data releases were delayed or cancelled which helped the stock market. Volatility was lower. On the other hand, Gold and Silver continued to rise. The White House's Hassett said layoffs will come if Trump thinks shutdown negotiations 'are going nowhere'. The Dollar Index started rising from 97.5. The stock market opened higher. During the session, Trump announced all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported will be tariffed 25%. It was the first attempt for tariffs, but the stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The Senate rejected Republican spending bill to end government shutdown. The stock market opened slightly higher. Precious metals have been very popular for a while and Goldman Sachs lifted its gold price target to $4,900 for 2026 year-end. The S&P 500 declined from 6,750 and pulled back. The stock market closed lower. The S&P 500 broken 7-day winning streak. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Gold rose above $4,000 for the first time in history. The stock market opened higher. Fed minutes were released and the stock market expects 2 more rate cut by the end of 2025. Next meeting will be October 29. CME FedWatch tool is showing 98% possibility of 25 point rate cut in October. The stock market closed higher. Nasdaq closed above 23,000 for the first time ever. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Silver gained more than 3.5% and surpassed $51. $49,81 was the highest since 2011. Thus, it surpassed. Israel and Hamas agreed on 'first phase' of Gaza ceasefire. The stock market opened higher. The Dollar Index continued rising and completed 4-day winning streak. It reached 99.50. As a result, Gold and Silver could not hold their gains. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Fed Governor Waller sees more rate cuts but central bank needs to be ""cautious about it"". Gold and Silver rebounded after Thursday’s loses. The stock market opened higher. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary came at 4.6% that slightly lower than last month's 4.7%, but it wasn't the focus for today because Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. Oil felt more than 4%. The stock market closed under heavy selling pressure. The S&P 500 felt more than 2.5% and Nasdaq dropped more than 3.5%. 🔴

The stock market continued to rise slowly while the government remaining closed. We did not see any labor market data, so the stock market could not get information from reports. The S&P 500 dropped more than 2.5% in a single day, but volume was only slightly above 20-day moving average. The stock market had made all-time high after another. I believe that we don't need to make any panic yet. We've seen this before.

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop. 

Just an example : EU can't find Germanium for their defense sector

à prendre aussi en compte que chez apple ils pensent différemment et donc si tu as déjà des habitudes il va falloir passer par une période pénible de désapprentissage.

pour finir des tablettes android qui font le boulot, ça existe. des versions pas chères qui sont nulle il y en a trop, mais si tu payes pour de la qualité ça fonctionne et ça reste moins cher que apple.

par contre si le budget n'est pas un problème et que tu n'as pas déjà des habitudes établies alors prends un ipad, mais prends un modèle avec un processeur apple silicon, au moins M2. le gain de performance et d'autonomie vaut la peine, si toutefois tu en as l'utilité.",frigocho,0,,,2025-10-11 02:05:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o389gt/ipad_ou_tablette/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o389gt/ipad_ou_tablette/niv2cix/

1o3ewij,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI,"Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned.

Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.

The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.

Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.

Xiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.

Investors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.

Prompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.

Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.

Silicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple’s deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company’s founder and other execs, and Google’s $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf’s CEO and leaders that included licensing fees.

Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple’s biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines.

Some analysts have attributed Apple’s relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps.

While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker’s foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users.

Prompt’s technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple’s HomeKit smart home division.

J'aimerais donc me prendre une tablette/ipad pour mes cours officiellement mais pas que bien évidemment. À côté j'aimerais pourvoir éditer des photos, faire du dessin (juste comme occupation tiers je ne suis pas Dali), regarde séries/films (classique), etc une utilisation polyvalente finalement.

1o2zf8d,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","**TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:
   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.*
* **ChatGPT reduction in citations**:
   * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.*
   * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*. OpenAI doesn't want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with* [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-google-search-trial-774f4774?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi2Aepz4YfkUzHlyW43XKFw5jYgLonf0RqC-XMCO1XblHovzKcMOxODMv7rkOY%3D&gaa_ts=68e8ec3f&gaa_sig=aoxKHEAywLIAKYAhJQLXOxevRchLEJ2gA5pO3e7p5VMHy7uJWtgMMSjRJ6U0IHEz5ppiUJPdvwSLlSbFSJdOUQ%3D%3D)*.*
   * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.*

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

nioflbj,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"There are two complicating factors right now. One is there is very little institutional shorting. Shorting is necessary for accurate price discovery. The other is share repurchases. Or the degree of share repurchases.

Onto your question, share repurchases provide buoyancy. Apple for example paid out more in share repurchases last quarter than the the company earned. That is from memory maybe it was the previous quarter.

Share Repurchases also can happen off market so that if anyone wants to sell the company can just prevent that selling pressure. 

Without institutions shorting what you have is only retail shorting stocks and the company buying shares which forces a rolling retail short squeeze. This is why the entire market is up since 2020 essentially. Just a prolonged retail short squeeze. This is an over simplification. PODs and algo shops are learning the patterns and magnifying this effect. Option writers/market makers are also using the volatility as well.

Just remember, no one has to  a *buy a s*tock for it to go.

Just one person has to be caught short and need to cover.

With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

 

Notable:

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48
4 Companies from 1999 had a positive return through 2006. 
5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

nigkund,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,What would you sell?,"> But Tesla’s valuation isn’t about how many cars it sells today, it’s about the potential of the ecosystem it’s building.

I am aware:

> > The others have some real operations going for them. If AI/Cloud slows down MS still has their OS and Office, Amazon still has server space and a store, Google and Meta still have their ads, and Apple still has their hardware. 

Your reasoning as to why Tesla is a good company is something I am pointing out as to why they are not. They are way too old to be a start up. Their manufacturing isn't as good as traditional cars and they are closing the gap on their electric offerings. Everyone else still has a product to keep them on top. Tesla hardly makes cars and with out the future hype they are not that much better than BYD or traditional manufacturers that offer electric. 

Take for example; Apple has put a lot of work into their ARM stuff. MS has not and it shows that MS is still on the prototype stage. Could MS be better than a macbook in the future as they push updates? Maybe, but what matters is how hardware is today and their willingness to push through. Tesla has been stuck on FSD being beta. Waymo seemingly already has one. In a sense they are like MS with ARM. They keep making claims about what they could do, but the delivery is still in ""its a start up so there are some edges that need to be polished"". Everyone else has something in production. Which my point is that everyone else has a real business to fall back on. MS could cut their windows on ARM and still be a solid company. Tesla cutting their FSD means they have no real product to sell out side of the brand name. 

Here is some homework for you; when did Elon first say FSD would be ready? Would you put up with that if you bought bespoke hardware that will be better at some point in the future? Pay a premium when you could just have a comparable competitor at a lower price with the same features minus the promise that it will get fixed in the future?",Wild_Alternative3563,1,,,2025-10-08 19:55:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/nigkund/

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

Not saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.

1o0xu4z,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Why I Think Chemours Could be the Next Big Mineral Play,"Ticker: $CC, Chemours Company

So why this company and why minerals? 

Minerals are hot right now; tariffs from the USA and China withholding critical minerals means that the world needs to adapt. Look at the example of China prevening any Gallium from being sold to the USA. This creates a need, and a need creates the market. [https://cen.acs.org/policy/trade/Firms-brace-China-ban-exports/102/web/2024/12](https://cen.acs.org/policy/trade/Firms-brace-China-ban-exports/102/web/2024/12)

Chemours is one of the biggest TiO2 companies globably. They take in ore which they refine to TiO2 to make paints, coatings, whatever, etc. Not interesting, but, they bring in a ton of ore, and recently (March 2025) they announced a strategic partnership with Energy Fuels (UUUU) to Create a Domestic Supply Chain of Critical Minerals for the United States. [**https://investors.chemours.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chemours-and-energy-fuels-forming-strategic-alliance-create**](https://investors.chemours.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chemours-and-energy-fuels-forming-strategic-alliance-create) In that article you can see Chemours has mines in Florida and Georgia where it currently gets its ores in addition to locations around the world. 

The ores are key. Now let's do some mild speculation. Here are the critical minerals for USA/Critical Minerals Alliances, [**https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/cms\_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/7/3/673/76194.pdf**](https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/7/3/673/76194.pdf)

* Cobalt 
* Graphite 
* Lithium 
* Nickel
* Rare earths (i.e. the lanthanide group and related elements)
* Gallium 
* Indium 
* Manganese
* Niobium
* Tellurium 
* Vanadium

The major minerals that contain Titanium are Ilmenite (FeTiO3), Leucoxene, and the more expensive Rutile (TiO2). Chemours is specifically leveraged to use poor quality ores. Look up there history, I am not interested in pulling it, but essentially that means they can use impure ore and refine it to TiO2. Here are some of their statements on what they receive from their mines. [**https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county**](https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county)**,** [**https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county**](https://www.chemours.com/en/about-chemours/global-reach/wayne-county)

Now, let's look at one of the major ores they use, Ilmenite. Yes, this ore is primarily Titanium, Iron (I will come back to this) and Oxygen. Super boring, I know, but what are the trace minerals? Remember, they use a ton of this ore. Everytime you paint a wall, make a plastic container, build pretty much anything that is white or pretty much any color, you use TiO2; even when you use that toilet paper to shit post, guess what, TiO2! So they use a ton of this ore. So, what are the trace minerals? [https://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/ilmenite.pdf](https://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/ilmenite.pdf)

*  **Vanadium (V)** \- commonly present in small amounts (depends on source), **CHECK!**
* **Chromium (Cr)** \- often found as minor impurities
* **Magnesium (Mg)** \- sometimes present, 
* **Manganese (Mn)** \- minor amounts, **CHECK!**
* **Nickel (Ni)** \- trace levels possible, **CHECK!**
* **Zirconium (Zr)** \- occasionally present
* **Rare Earth Elements (REEs)** \- sometimes detected in low concentrations, **Not really, but CHECK** See below for support they are interested in rare earth metals **,**[**https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2022/10/17/10815713/us-chemours-starts-up-tio2-mineral-sands-mine/**](https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2022/10/17/10815713/us-chemours-starts-up-tio2-mineral-sands-mine/)

So, where does that leave us? They have announced a partnership for refining the ores and have ore with plenty of valuble resources, and they could build or are building the expertise to leverage those components. If we use are sub-room temp IQ that means, tendies! I use the braindead examples of UUUU, MP, LAC, minerals are in, a 100%, 200%, 300%, increase is totally possible. They could be a real supplier in these critical minerals. But, wait, what about all of that Iron? Here are some important uses for Iron as battery materials. [https://investor.vistracorp.com/2022-01-24-Vistra-Announces-Expansion-of-Worlds-Largest-Battery-Energy-Storage-Facility](https://investor.vistracorp.com/2022-01-24-Vistra-Announces-Expansion-of-Worlds-Largest-Battery-Energy-Storage-Facility)

Well, the critical use of Lithium Iron Phosphate Batteries (LPF) is recent (\~5 YEAR) with critical innovation for electrical grid security. The USA will need more of those to help even and enhance the grid. But, who are the major suppliers? Why would we care about LPF? Is this a good source, Idk, I am tired. [https://www.bntbattery.com/news/top-10-global-lithium-iron-phosphate-lfp-battery-cell-manufacturers/](https://www.bntbattery.com/news/top-10-global-lithium-iron-phosphate-lfp-battery-cell-manufacturers/)

* **CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd.** China
* **BYD** China
* **Gotion High‑Tech** China
* **EVE Energy** China
* **SVOLT** China
* **REPT Battero**, China
* **Envision AESC,** China
* **Lishcen Battery,** China
* **Great Power**, China
* **Wanxiang A123**, China

Hmmm, I guess there might be a problem here. If an American company decided to start refining LPF or at least Iron for LPF, they could have a significant tariff and home town advantage. If you think Chemour is not, I think you are a fool. 

The bad: PFAS, enough said, they have the liability, but they are a huge minerals company waiting to happen.

I don't have much money left, yes I was diagnosed, so here goes what I have left for some shares!

Following near-term movement of $LION, you'll see 5-10% swings on such LOW volume that it is laughable. I expect on any real news to see this stock doubling at worst.  
  
We have moved up 25% on rumors, and 25% on other company expectations with no direct correlation to $LION.

1o0szdz,post,StockMarket,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Can you really invest more than half your portfolio in a single stock?,"I was analyzing some data on top investors and noticed that a few funds have massive concentration in just one position. CAS Investment Partners has over 80% of its portfolio in Carvana (CVNA), and Fairholme Capital holds nearly 79% in St. Joe (JOE). Even Apple shows up as a dominant holding for others, making up more than 60% of total portfolio value.

How can an individual investor realistically take on that kind of concentration and still sleep well at night? On one hand, high conviction bets have created some of the best returns in history. On the other, it’s a ton of risk if that one stock turns against you. All advisors keep on saying to distribute across sectors.

How do you all think about portfolio concentration vs. diversification? Have you ever held one stock that made up more than 50% of your portfolio? If so, how did you decide when to trim or rebalance? I’d love to hear both the success stories or not from going all-in on conviction plays.

ni4yx4a,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,What would you sell?,"I can tell you what I did.   My 27 yr old child bought a condo in Manhattan last year and we had to make roughly the same decisions about stock sales to make her $400k downpayment. She had about $1,000,000 in her brokerage account with many of the same stocks that you identified.     I would say that the first things I did was to sell all her losing positions and harvest any tax losses.  That was only about $20k but included Boeing, Southwest Airlines, CVS.   I left most of her ETF and international investments alone as I thought that selling those would concentrate her exposure to individual US stocks when this is really a better time to lower allocation risk.   That left what to with the remaining stocks.  I generally took a bowl haircut to every single one of them so they would not exceed $50k/5% in any one stock.   That included META, GOOGL, AAPL, NVDA, PANW, and also some non-tech stocks like V, UNH.  My thinking on this is that this was the equivalent of doing the reverse of dollar cost averaging into stocks:  I was dollar cost averaging out of the stocks.  So the bigger winners (META, AAPL, UNH, V) were sold more heavily.   And some stocks that had done poorly in the last year I left completely intact, like AMD, BABA, PSTG.  Finally, I totally sold her TSLA holdings and halved the money she had in PLTR.   I think both stocks are silly expensive and my D did not like the politics of either so it’s not worth holding them anymore and getting grief from her about them.  

TLDR; I gave all the stocks an equal haircut.  It has the advantage of 1) minimizing capital gains taxes, 2) de-risking her portfolio significantly so ETFs play a bigger role in her returns going forward, 3) reducing FOMO because she is still invested in the same companies 4) in the several months since the sell-off her stock account is back over $800,000 and she is a homeowner.",doughboy_491,1,,,2025-10-06 23:10:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/ni4yx4a/

I’m curious how others here are positioned. Do these large-cap stocks make up a significant portion of your portfolio, or have you started rotating into smaller or undervalued sectors? What’s your current allocation strategy, and how are you thinking about balancing growth vs. value in this market?

The hypothesis was some will take off more so than others. People at Reddit argued and downvoted each other proving he has the vision more than others.

I started out with \~150 different stocks/warrants using some risk aversion model built based on volatility calculation I narrowed 150 down to 15-20 better performed companies. All together, I attained +15% return on a 6 figure investment budget.  Some companies like rocket space travel and eVtol are still around 5 years later.

With Trevor Milton's disastrous Nikola scam, I called it quits sold all and put proceeds with +15% return in safer place.

I read some posts here discussing companies that have good growth potential. 
Often, I have not heard of those companies because they are still growing and are not mainstream yet. 

I will go and read about the companies I learn from those posts and find it very interesting. I am very impressed that someone was able to pick that company as the next big thing. 

I think it is a good skill to learn. Please suggest how I can learn it. 
How do you discover such companies? What is the criteria you use to determine that a particular company has growth potential ? 
Are there any websites or tools you recommend ? 


DISCLAIMER: I am not very knowledgeable about stocks. I invest in them through index funds. But occasionally I buy individual stocks if I know and like the company, like Costco, Reddit and Apple. I use their products or services daily.

I'm telling you guys. Don't read the headlines of bearish news. The way the data is being collected is very inaccurate and outdated. Its based off surveys, and the data tends to change month to month. Its kinda like how in 2016 election, polling was being done via land-lines and had Clinton winning by a landslide.

1nwxygo,post,eupersonalfinance,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Uk app for Euro investments,"Hi all. I had an account with Trade Republic to invest in Euro with. I had downloaded it through my UK account on the Apple app store. A few weeks ago it demanded that I update the app, but as it’s no longer available in the UK I was completely locked out of the app and all my money. 
Of course, TR customer service was impossible to reach. 
I had some serious cash in there, so I’ve had to cancel all my apple subscriptions, wait until they expired, switch to the Spain app store, update the app and finally get in there. I’ve now sold everything and it’s safely in my bank account. PHEW!! 😰 
So, as in the headline, I’m now looking for a broker that offers its app in the UK, accepts Euro as cash and for investments, and has cheap fees. Suggestions?

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Nobody wants to send messages via WhatsApp in America. They might have a good chance at being internationally successful though. But also the hardware will be easy to replicate and other counties will have their own cheaper versions. Look how cell phones are these days.

I current have to pay $70 for personal Microsoft office products (word/excel). I stopped paying last year and have since used Google office products which have been free and seen no issues.

Would love to see more Google apps available more easily on the home screen.

Not a easy task going against Microsoft - but lets see how it plays out. They did this with Chromebook in 2011 and made it the biggest laptops for education in the world. A gamble that paid off.

nhcajt6,comment,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Do they need to beat or just be a serious player? We’ve seen with cell phones the market boiled down to two choices: iOS or Android. Microsoft couldn’t/wouldn’t break into the market. There are many manufacturers of Android devices, with variations in hardware & packaged software, but there are only two core OSes.

Meta has RayBan, Apple has nothing (yet?), Google has… nothing? Samsung? Sony? What other consumer electronics and services giant has an AR product nearing launch?

Let’s say SNAP releases their glasses and they gain reasonable traction - several million units? Does Apple or some other big player gobble them up? Release their own solution, integrated with their services, and crush SNAP? OP is suggesting SNAP’s app and loyal user base is their moat. I don’t know about that. People can be pretty fickle about which social platform is popular.

Can SNAP be the Android or iOS of AR? Meaning they have a good software ecosystem that lots of developers adopt? But other manufacturers (Samsung, Apple) will want a piece of the hardware money.

My speculation is that SNAP will have a decent product better than Meta’s RayBans due to being released later with better hardware specs. It will gain some traction and buzz (pop the stock) and then Tim Apple will release his own product slickly integrated into iOS and Apple’s ecosystem & SNAP’s hardware will be forgotten and they will become an app on Apple’s platform.",NatureBoyJ1,11,,,2025-10-02 12:32:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/nhcajt6/

There's another spin: it's not fail proof BUT it shifted responsibility from issuer/merchant to cardholder. Both N26 and Apple can raise their hands and say it's not their fault so they don't need to reimburse. 

OP, do you use SMS as 3rd party authenticator for these transactions? Make sure your number is not compromised. 

I'm surprised that I didn't see any comment suggesting you to file a complaint with the Bundesbank. Usually banks try to avoid this from happening as much as possible - depending on the value involved they might decide to swallow the loss. At the very least, it's another case against what Visa / Master did with 3D Secure.

Personally, I have a set up that contains the damage if something like that happens. Separate card from the bank's card that's used for purchases. One-time virtual cards are great for online purchases, a virtual card + Apple/Google pay is better than using the physical card because you can delete it if case of problems.

nhaerj9,comment,eupersonalfinance,AAPL,Apple Inc.,My virtual debit card got compromised and I lost all of my savings,"AFAIK 3d secure doesn’t mean every single transaction gets checked. There’s a mechanism for skipping identification checks for amounts lower than a certain amount, €50 or sth. Basically, the merchant can choose to bear the responsibility in exchange for a smoother checkout. 

I’m guessing this is why N26 is stalling. Start talking to Apple as well. They are also responsible, doubly so if you’re an existing apple user, because it means they could have checked but didnt.

As far as I understand, credit cards are regulated more tightly, and also targeted more, hence a bit more safe. As in, CC companies always have insurance and this is just another tuesday for them.

I had sth similar with my credit card. Somehow got stolen and like 50 transactions were made on Apple store with varying amounts. It was super easy to identify as well because they didn’t show up on my Apple purchase history. 

My credit card company(ICS) was super helpful. They went through the list of all transactions to identify fraudulent ones and then basically gave me a phone number to call Apple’s dedicated fraud dept. in NL, which then reversed all the charges. They were also super reassuring that if anything were to get missed they would cover it. 

Would definitely recommend ICS just for this interaction alone.",tatarjr,5,,,2025-10-02 03:10:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1nvffgc/my_virtual_debit_card_got_compromised_and_i_lost/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1nvffgc/my_virtual_debit_card_got_compromised_and_i_lost/nhaerj9/
1nvpvso,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.  
  
**Position:** 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks. ",barack_obama_jr,342,0.87,225.0,2025-10-02 02:53:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/

Nevertheless, try looking at it as analytical as you can and try to understand the difference between a bank withdrawal based on allowing a company to do that vs. a payment made through ""card present"" (smartphone NFC or the physical card) vs. an online payment through the credit card system (e.g. Going through 3D secure and the three digit security code on the back of the card) vs. a transfer out initiated from your online Banking account. 

Instead of blaming n26 first try to find out what kind of withdrawal the entries in your account statement exactly are. 

What sounds most likely is that you authorized your apple account to withdraw from your bank account or card but you did not secure your apple account well enough.  In that case you should see the transactions in the Apple account and they may be able to trace something down.",_nku,2,,,2025-10-01 20:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1nvffgc/my_virtual_debit_card_got_compromised_and_i_lost/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1nvffgc/my_virtual_debit_card_got_compromised_and_i_lost/nh8f4j3/

The burden of proof for authorised transactions lays on the bank.

Now, that doesn’t mean they will not try to turn it around and make you prove that. In the end the best story for them is deny everything per email and on the phone until you give up and they don’t need to return anything. It’s their business to keep the money and to not pay it back.
So stop talking to them, you’ve tried enough. Go put your Rechtsschutzversicherung to use, get a lawyer and start the legal action. Not threaten the legal action - start it.

1nvg1dy,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",JuanPabloElTres,405,0.88,300.0,2025-10-01 20:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/

Just because you use virtual card, it doesn't make it any safer online, it still uses card number and the 3 numbers on back.

My best guess is you got phished without realising it (didn't have to happen very recently) and they bought apple gift cards and since you already authorized multiple purchases from Apple before, it won't prompt for confirmation everytime.

1nvffgc,post,eupersonalfinance,AAPL,Apple Inc.,My virtual debit card got compromised and I lost all of my savings,"If anyone here understands banking and debit card technology properly, can you explain how is it possible for a virtual debit card, connected only to my Google Pay wallet to be compromised such that someone else from a different location made several transactions using my card until my balance went to 0?

I did a lot of research because I genuinely want to prevent this from happening in the future. The alternative is that I lose all trust in banks and start keeping physical cash in a safe. According to my research, only physical cards are at risk of being 'skimmed' at gas stations or compromised ATM terminals. Tap-to-pay are much more safe, because Google and Apple Pay creates a temporary unique transaction ID everytime you tap your card. Therefore, it is not possible for someone to steal your card info. If you use the virtual card at an online shop and put in your info there, the 2nd layer of security would send a 3d-secure confirmation to your banking app. So, I can't understand how my virtual card got compromised.

I had used this card to pay for a TV show on Apple TV. 3 months later, someone else used the card to steal all my money and my bank statement says 'Apple'. Apple support told me they confirm that someone else used my card. I don't understand how the 3d-secure system didn't work. How someone else authorised the transaction without my knowledge. This breaks my trust in the security of banks and card companies in general.

It's been 3 months since this happened and my bank has still not returned the money. (it is N26).

ngvtnbz,comment,options,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Wrote some covered calls GOOGL, TSLA, AAPL","Hi, are these CCs your first foray into the wonderful world of options?  
You've probably done fine on those, I haven't looked yet, but if you're new I'd implore you to read a book.  
This one is solid without being too technical and dense:

 [Options for the Beginner and Beyond,](https://www.r-5.org/files/books/trading/schoolbooks/W_Edward_Olmstead-Options_for_the_Beginner_and_Beyond-EN.pdf) by Professor (of Applied Mathematics) Olmstead of Northwestern University

And just read Chapters 1 through 5 for now, skipping over any discussion of Puts.  
But add Chapter 14 for the Covered Calls you're already doing.

Then read Chapter 7, Assignment Anxiety, to learn why you don't need to worry much at all about your covered shares getting called away.  
  
The standard recommendation is to sell Calls 30-45 days out (so you're in too tight with 1 week) and at 30-delta.  
Though if you find those are getting consistently run over and you just don't want to bother with rolling them all the time, you can certainly back down to 25 or even 20-delta.

And oh yeah, now that I've looked, you probably sold those TSLA Calls *way* OTM.  Maybe 5 or 6-delta when you sold them?  You could've sold them at 16-delta for about 3 times as much, probably.  
16-delta is significant because it's ""the 1SD move,"" or what your trading platform might show as Expected Move.  
But a lot of things work; heck, you could sell them ATM if you wanted and not worry much about assignment, as Chapter 7 will tell you.

Your AAPL call is at 32-delta now, so you might've sold it a little close to the money.  
GOOG is right at that 16-delta/1SD point, though it was probably higher when you sold it.

**Do you know how to manage these?**

1) Buy them back when they're worth *half* of what you sold them for.

2) Or roll them at some arbitrary Delta.  If I'm selling at 30-delta, I'm rolling them by 40.  If selling at 20-25, then rolling by 30.  In general, I try to move them back toward their initial Delta.  Eventually there'll be a downturn in the stock that sucks the value out of them and you'll be able to buy them back for half.  
Oh, and generally try for a Credit when you roll, though I'll sometimes take a 10 to 15-cent Debit if it helps me roll.",TheInkDon1,11,,,2025-09-29 21:43:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1ntptjw/wrote_some_covered_calls_googl_tsla_aapl/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1ntptjw/wrote_some_covered_calls_googl_tsla_aapl/ngvtnbz/

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

WDYT, folks? Are you with Jonny or Kattie on this one?",phoenix-of-zen,0,0.29,6.0,2025-09-29 19:27:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nto9qg/investment_advice_from_a_friend_wdyt/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nto9qg/investment_advice_from_a_friend_wdyt/

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking “to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse.”


While the department’s scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

“BLS will suspend all operations,” the 73-page plan stated. “Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released",thelastsubject123,1341,0.98,193.0,2025-09-29 18:12:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/
1ntlfop,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",Goatofoptions,0,0.47,9.0,2025-09-29 17:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/
1ntjtyt,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",phoenix-of-zen,0,0.27,12.0,2025-09-29 16:41:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-10-03.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",intraalpha,19,0.83,4.0,2025-09-29 16:05:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1ntix8d/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1ntix8d/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/

1nse5u1,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume.

EU member states and the European parliament are hoping to reach a deal on the final text of the regulation this autumn.

This is just a proposal to exclude Meta, Apple, Google and Amazon from a new system for sharing financial data which is also just a proposal. As usual, the EU is moving at a glacial speed.

I wanted to share my situation and see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

On **14 September 2025**, several **unauthorized transactions (\~€2.2k)** were made with my N26 card in Murcia, Spain, while I was physically in Berlin.

Steps I took immediately:

* Blocked my card right away
* Filed a police report (already submitted to N26)
* Escalated to **BaFin** (German regulator) and the **consumer protection office**
* Shared publicly for awareness

**N26’s response:**  
They closed my case and refuse to refund me. Their justification is that I supposedly *authorized* a third party to add my card to their Apple Pay, and therefore the transactions are my responsibility.  
This is **completely unacceptable** to me — I never gave such authorization. Even N26 acknowledges it was fraud, but they shift the blame to me instead of protecting the customer.

👉 My questions:

* Has anyone else had a similar issue with N26 (or another bank) regarding Apple Pay fraud?
* Any advice on further legal / consumer protection steps in Germany?

1nqz43z,post,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Open AI will be the loser in the end as all AI becomes like internet providers or cell phone providers,"In the final days all of the major AI players will be able to offer the same services. And, the consumer always wins. It will be a price war. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Xia/Tesla all offer something else to make money off and will win the price war for pure play AI as it turns into a commodity like access to the internet

I will add that in the end everything gets commoditized unless you have monopoly power. With the hyperscalers, China, India, and smaller US operations doing it you can switch and churn in an out of each of the AI chatbots. Again the consumer always wins.

And, the power needs 10GW for stargate is insane, we are talking 100s of millions of dollars for electricity if not more since they will have to subsidize the build out. Cooling is another massive cost. How will they make money charging people $200 per month. There will be a price war as they will have to charge closer to $2000 per month but then Apple will come out with its in phone AI that doesnt touch the cloud as much for an extra $400 and these hyperscalers will pull there hair out.

1nqwu3l,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Sep 26, 2025","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most breaches do happen because of people fucking up their own shit.  

This is why in so many companies users cannot install shit on the devices from the company assigned to them. Funnily, except phones most of the time.  
In practice, having that (imperfect as it is) gatekeeper of Apple or Google does decrease the risk for the device.  

I think this is why this argument is chosen, because the words that are used are correct.  

**BUT** doing this moves people from being the owner to a user of a device. And this is especially critical if in practice the ""owner"", the only one who can do whatever with the device, always remains with the manufacturer.

ng9gsws,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"European Union rejected a call by Apple to scrap its landmark digital competition law on Thursday, dismissing the US giant's claims that the rules put users' security at risk.","Just a warning to all iOS users: When you delete an app, and iOS tells you that it will also delete all of this app's data, it in fact doesnt delete it. It also stores all your old usernames and passwords into iCloud keychain, to which you don't have access to.

If you dont believe me, try it. For ""lulz"" create Tinder account, set up pictures and all, and then delete the app. What iOS will tell you is that it will delete all of the app data, but when you reinstall the app, ALL The data(Picutres, description, likes, etc) will be instantly back in app, without you even needing to login into the app. IT'S ALL ALREADY THERE, you are logged in and ""ready to go"".

You can also try this with reddit. If you used a reddit account, later deleted it, and created a new one, the old one will still appear after you reinstall the app. Which basically means that if you ever used any app that required you to create an account, and later deleted that account, thinking it is done, that account info(login credentials and passwords) are still in Apple keychain, even though iOS tells you that all of data has been deleted.

And the worst part? You dont have access to this data. You cant see which login credentials and passwords are stored in this keychain. Yes, tere is ""Passwords"" app on your iphone, but that app is just a ""mirage"" because even if you delete ALL accounts/login credentials in there, it will still pull them up from this keychain. So Apple is actually storing all your old data and passwords in this keychain, and you cannot see it, you cannot edit it, you cannot delete it, and you cannot access it, and basically 99.9% of users dont even know it because iOS tells them that it's all deleted.

And what this also does, is that it enables apps like Reddit, to instantly know who you are, even if you just browse via Reddit app without an account, basically like an internet cookie, that you cannot delete. Imagine if every browser, in which you delete your browsing history(cache, cookies, logins, etc) tells you ""All is deleted"", and then when you visit certain website, your login credentials are already set up, or you are already logged in.

It's a HUGE privacy risk, and apple should and must know it, but they keep deceiving their users about how ""all app data is deleted"" if you ever delete an app. It is not.",Onlypizzafans69,25,,,2025-09-26 08:23:31,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250925-apple-asks-eu-to-scrap-landmark-digital-competition-law,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nqqltv/european_union_rejected_a_call_by_apple_to_scrap/ng9gsws/

First off, that's bullshit, Samsung is regulated by the DMA (and any other applicable EU law) just like Apple, or any other company, is.

But theres also the thing that Samsung, and the OS they use, is less ""looked dowm"" then IOS is.

Like before the DMA requirements if you wanted to ""sideload"" anything on a IOS device you needed to jailbreak the fucking thing which wasnt the case for Samsung devices, at least that is not to the same extent as with any IOS device (any other device running some version of Android, be it the original or a modified version of the open source, is the same story basically)

Essentially all Samsung needed to do to comply with this part of the DMA was not lock down their OS (which they weren't doing anyway for several reasons)

But for Apple they needed to partially ""unlock"" their OS (that being IOS of course) for EU users so, basically, Apple being little fuckers and locking down IOS (for entirely greedy reasons) just ended up biting them it seems 😂😂😂😂",Necessary_Pie2464,0,,,2025-09-25 23:59:58,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/25/apple-calls-for-changes-to-anti-monopoly-laws-and-says-it-may-stop-shipping-to-the-eu,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nqc1v1/apple_calls_for_changes_to_antimonopoly_laws_and/ng7doho/

If we assume they stop shipping to europe, Android takes over, people complain about android and Android starts getting its shit together, some manufacturer comes up that can cater to a high market like europe, eventually android becomes good enough and better perceived in upmarkets so that it will start threatening apple everywhere not just here.

They cannot risk that happening, just like Microsoft can't risk Windows getting banned in europe and everyone switches to open source, leading companies to invest heavily in linux since now there's a good high margin market for it, meaning linux gradually becomes good enough to threaten windows supremacy.

Right now for example nobody cares about the linux desktop because companies don't develop for it, but if all of a sudden we get a guaranteed market for it, everyone and everything will invest it.",manu144x,10,,,2025-09-25 22:04:33,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/25/apple-calls-for-changes-to-anti-monopoly-laws-and-says-it-may-stop-shipping-to-the-eu,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nqc1v1/apple_calls_for_changes_to_antimonopoly_laws_and/ng6qxj7/

To me it feels like the commission is helicoptering Apple so much that they don’t notice everyone else is doing whatever they want in the meantime. 

Also this gatekeeper stuff is to me a bit randomly. I understand that Apples App Store practice were and still are shady af and that something needed to be done about it. I also understand that something like Airdrop should be available to communicate with other phones or that they needed to implement RCS or whatever it was called.

But Apple needing to run to the EU commission for every single functionality they provide, where other companies don’t have to justify themselves *at all* for, is kinda ridiculous especially given their market share. They will not move on to the next company once they’re done with Apple because Apple releases features faster than the EU commission works.

Apple’s point here is that they are not allowed to have their Live translation feature in the EU if they limit it to their own AirPod products.

Opening up an API to third parties isn't a security issue, since you can still require authentication/user consent/other gates.

What Apple cares about a lot more is making sure their own products have various advantages stemming from 1st party integration that simply isn't possible to be matched by third parties. This means when you're buying an iPhone, you're a lot more likely to buy Apple Watch, Air Pods, Air Tag and other Apple products instead of alternative ones.

I'm not really sure why people like you are rushing to defend one of the richest mega corporations in the world. Yeah in ideal world we'd have a lot more competition in the market so we wouldn't have to regulate stuff like this , but reality is that you have Apple and Google essentially owning entire smartphone market and they've proven over and over again they won't play nice if they don't need to.

**TL;DR :**

J'ai crée une série de science-fiction en mode audiobook illustré, aujourd'hui je publie le prologue et les deux premiers chapitres :

[Aetherciel](https://youtu.be/TQ9_cEl0fCc?si=Y7TSndw2wbsvjWQn) *(lien YouTube)*

Fans d'œuvres telles que *The Expanse, Mass Effect, Foundation, Halo, Hyperion, Dune...* vous devriez y trouver votre compte. 

Merci de leur donner une chance. :) 

  
\*

Et pour tous ceux qui voudraient aller un peu plus loin, déjà salut à toutes et à tous et un immense merci pour avoir cliqué sur le thread. 

Je copie/colle la description que j'ai rédigée pour YouTube ci-dessous : 

*Aetherciel est une série de science-fiction.*

*Les dix vidéos (un prologue, huit chapitres, un épilogue) sortiront au rythme d’une par semaine, les mercredis à 18h30, jusqu’au chapitre 8 qui sortira accompagné de l’épilogue.*

 *Oui, les images ont été réalisées par IA, mais tout le reste (écriture, narration, montage, mixage… mais aussi, pourrait-on arguer, la rédaction de prompts pour les illustrations) est de ma main ou de ma voix.*

*Dans un monde idéal, je travaillerais avec des illustrateurs et des musiciens. Je n’en ai clairement pas les moyens pour l’instant mais qui sait, si le projet se développe…*

*Donc c’était soit ça, soit juste le texte sur champ étoilé, et j’avais vraiment envie de conférer une dimension visuelle au récit.*

*Merci beaucoup de votre compréhension et vous souhaitant un excellent visionnage !*

  
\*

Mais je compte développer un peu plus que ça ci-dessous, donc bonne lecture à tous ceux qui seraient intéressés par la genèse et les coulisses du projet ! :)

Par où commencer ? Les débuts sont souvent difficiles...

Bref...

J'écris depuis que je suis gamin. Oui, c'est bateau à dire, mais raconter des histoires à toujours été ma première passion depuis que le petiot que j'étais à découvert tout ce qui est *Tolkien, Harry Potter, Ewilan, A la Croisée des Mondes, Artemis Fowl, Le Livre des Etoiles, Alex Rider...*, j'en passe et des meilleurs (gamins des années 90, TMTC).  

Puis bien sur, les gouts littéraires évoluent avec l'âge, mais je n'ai jamais laissé tomber la SF et la fantasy pour autant. De ces sagas jeunesses je suis passé à GRRM, Robin Hobb, David Gemmell, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Alastair Reynolds, Phillip K. Dick, Ursula Le Guin, James S.A. Corey... pour ne citer que les plus connus. Au passage, grosse mention à Adrian Tchaikovsky qui est aujourd'hui mon auteur préféré.

D'ailleurs si je devais lister les deux plus grosses influences à Aetherciel, ce serait The Expanse (James S.A. Corey) et The Final Architecture (Adrian Tchaikovksy)... mais bon, quand il est question de space-opera, *Star Wars, Dune* et *Foundation* ne sont inévitablement jamais bien loin. 

Je disais donc...

J'écris depuis tout gamin, j'ai autopublié quelques bouquins et quelques unes de mes nouvelles ont été retenues dans des anthologies, mais bon, rien qui a vraiment percé (ou qui méritait de percer, j'en suis bien conscient)... Et comme ça peut se deviner à mes influences, ce dont je rêve, c'est de créer une putain de saga de science-fiction/fantasy dans la lignée de tous les noms que j'ai cités précédemment... et c'est du boulot, le travail de décennies entières.

Je pense que beaucoup d'auteurs se retrouveront dans ce que je vais dire, mais j'ai mon petit paquet de ""premiers tomes non poursuivis"" à mon actif. C'est un sacré challenge de trouver la motivation de s'accrocher quand on voit la montagne à gravir et que, admettons-le, au fil de la vingtaine, les envies d'écriture peuvent évoluer assez vite... Suffit d'écrire un premier tome, puis, quelques années plus tard, commencer à rédiger le deuxième pour se rendre compte qu'on a envie de tout reprendre à zéro parce qu'on à muri et changé. 

Cependant, aujourd'hui, je pense (peut-être à tort) que je tiens quelque chose...

Mais je vais trop vite... Revenons quelques années en arrière.

Nous sommes en 2020, nous sommes en plein confinement, et inspiré par des YouTubeurs tels que Exurb1a ou Alterhis qui m'ont prouvé qu'il y avait un certain public sur la plateforme pour de la fiction pure et dure, je me suis motivé à adapter l'une de mes nouvelles en vidéo : 

[Suicide of the Sun](https://youtu.be/wGo9cVv0noM?si=MhrAjayomZHPvpgr) *(lien YouTube)*

Attention, c'est en anglais (ouais, j'avais envie d'atteindre un public plus international), contrairement à *Aetherciel*, et c'est une histoire assez dark. Et malgré ses défauts, je suis encore aujourd'hui hyper fier de cette vidéo. 

Motivé par ce premier essai, l'idée de créer une saga entière pour YouTube commence à faire tranquillement son chemin... Mais encore une fois, quand tu songes à la montagne que ça va être à gravir, tu peux très facilement te décourager. Surtout quand tu te dis qu'à tous les coups, tu ne feras pas plus d'une cinquantaine de vues parce que YouTube est une putain de jungle... ce qui me découragerait pas mal à perséverer, mais on y est pas encore... 

Enfin bref... Nous sommes plus de cinq ans après que l'idée ait commencé à germer dans mon esprit. Plus d'un an et demi d'écriture (j'ai terminé la rédaction en janvier), six mois de montage pour réaliser les dix vidéos (j'ai commencé dans la foulée, en janvier, et j'ai terminé les derniers reshoots il y'a une dizaine de jours)... Et nous y voilà. 

Oui, il y a eu des reshoots... J'ai intégralement retourné le prologue et les trois premiers chapitres par exemple. Après avoir tout réalisé et regardé la saga d'une traite, je me suis bien rendu compte de la progression, tant dans la narration que le montage et surtout dans l'interprétation des personnages, dans la manière dont je leur trouve et donne voix. Les premières versions des premiers chapitres étaient... ""plates"", quasiment la même voix pour tous les personnages vu que je n'osais pas vraiment me lâcher, contrairement aux derniers qui étaient beaucoup plus vibrants.

Mais, pour l'anecdote, autant je suis plutôt satisfait de la manière dont j'ai refait les trois premiers chapitres, autant le prologue c'est une autre histoire... La narration dans la première version est plus ""morne"" (pour ne pas dire déprimée)... et en fait, ça colle au ton de la vidéo. Je dis ça parce que je suis un peu emmerdé... j'ai un peu peur que certaines personnes soient refroidies par le ton du prologue, mais cette narration morose convient vraiment au texte. Promis, c'est plus vivant dès le premier chapitre. 

Là où je suis un peu emmerdé aussi, c'est de ne publier qu'une vidéo par semaine (après ce premier batch). J'ai l'impression que le récit gagne à être vu d'une traite et qu'un seul chapitre par semaine ne soit pas assez... d'autant plus que les huit chapitres marchent bien ""deux par deux"", mais ce serait se tirer une balle dans le pied au niveau de l'algorithme... Cependant, je comprendrais que certaines personnes préfèrent attendre que tout soit disponible avant de se lancer dedans, même si ce ne serait pas l'idéal pour l'algo... Putain d'algo... 

Tout comme ""putain de promotion""... Je suis en train de m'initier à TikTok pour partager quelques extraits, et il faut encore que je configure les liens podcasts pour ceux qui préferaient des plateformes telles que Spotify, Deezer, Amazon ou Apple Podcast... Le récit peut s'écouter en audio uniquement, mais les images ajoutent pas mal il me semble... mais je laisserai ceux qui écouteront en audio uniquement me dire ce qu'ils en pensent. 

Vous allez sans doute tomber sur ce même thread si vous trainez sur d'autres subreddits francophones. Je veux éviter de faire de la promo sauvage, mais il faut quand même que je partage un peu ça... et puis Reddit c'est ma plateforme de coeur, c'est vraiment à vous que j'ai envie de partager ça avant tout. 

Modos, merci pour votre compréhension. :) 

Anyways... voilà, voilà... Il y'a sans doute plein d'autres trucs que je pourrais dire, mais au fond, autant laisser le récit parler de lui-même.

Donc encore mille mercis pour me donner ma chance et bon visionnage à toutes et à tous.

nfw5svn,comment,options,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"IV on different options pricing , and general stock iv . Are they different ??","No. 

20% IV doesn’t mean Apple will move 20% or 20% it will move.   
  
It means the market is pricing about a 20% standard deviation for the returns over a year. 

So with APL at $256, 20% IV means the market expects about a $51 move up or down over the next year (1standard deviation). 

But that’s annualized so if you want the 30-day expected move, you scale by sqrt(30/365) = 0.29. So about 6% in a month.  
Again it is an expectation. It doesn't mean at all the stock will move 6%.   
In fact to help you build some intuition, it means that the market ""think"" (but maybe wrong) that the stock has roughly 66% chance to be within a -6/+6% range within a month.",sharpetwo,9,,,2025-09-24 06:14:04,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np0qgj,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1np0qgj/iv_on_different_options_pricing_and_general_stock/nfw5svn/
nfvyop2,comment,options,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"IV on different options pricing , and general stock iv . Are they different ??","IV is not the stock will move 20%. It is the annualized standard deviation the market is implying. A 20% IV on AAPL does not mean it can go up/down 20%; it means the market is pricing about a 20% one-year move (1 standard deviation). If you want the 30-day expected move, you scale that down by square root of (30/365).

But let's take a step back from the math and IV. IV is nothing else than the expression of supply and demand for each contract in the option chain.

Therefore, every option has its own IV because we back out IV from its price: if the price is high, once normalized (for strike time to expiry, dividend, rate and where the underlying currently trades), it will show a high IV or just put it simply, a high demand for that specific contract. It's that simple and that is why you get an IV surface/curve; it helps to see where the demand for contract is high and where it is low.

The fact that a $350 strike call shows low IV and a deep ITM call shows sky-high IV does not mean “the market thinks ITM will move more.” It is just the math of inverting option pricing. And that is how you end up with a ""volatility smile"": it is the representation of the market appetite for insurance (usually on the downside) because overall, the market is long.",sharpetwo,44,,,2025-09-24 05:22:43,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np0qgj,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1np0qgj/iv_on_different_options_pricing_and_general_stock/nfvyop2/
1np0qgj,post,options,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"IV on different options pricing , and general stock iv . Are they different ??","IV across different option strike price

Hi guys I did some reading about IV

So higher IV means higher price movement which means it can fluctuate easily.
Just a question does a 20% IV means a price can  go up or down 20%? Is it

So to price a premium you have to opt in IV? ( say for AAPL example at here underlying about 254Dollars

With that being said, OTM options are harder to reach, so IV is really low on a 350Dollars strike call option?

And a 105Dollars deep ITM strike (15k USD premium ) has about 97%
Does this mean this 15K premium is being priced in a 97% IV thats why so expensive??

How come deep deep itm is being calculated with high IV?

So to read this curve chart does it means the call higher strike price has lower iv
And itm call has higher iv

Im abit confusing with the iv on the each option and for the underlying stock price

I know when I buy an option I should look for low iv period for the general IV of a current stock
But I dont quite understand how come each option has its own IV too



1st and 2nd picture is IV of different strike price
3rd is the volatility curve",kyyap852,19,0.77,15.0,2025-09-24 04:33:15,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np0qgj,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1np0qgj/iv_on_different_options_pricing_and_general_stock/

In general they have a time decay so if the price stays constant they’ll generally lose money. This isn’t magic, it’s just how the market works, though you can model and calculate it. If I asked you to pay me $5 for the ability to buy apple at the current price next week, you’d be less likely to take that than if I asked you to pay me $5 for a chance to purchase it at the current price two years from now.

Apple is now basically near ath again, so OP probably bought when apple was on a downswing and it came back up.

But options still respect underlying changes as long as they are happening faster than the general time decay.",wentwj,3,,,2025-09-23 18:50:34,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnoawe,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nnoawe/best_trade_of_my_life/nfsnqxi/

Everyone knows Nvidia invested in Open AI with 100 billions dollars. So, Open AI will get 100 billions dollars to buy Nvidia chipset for their data centers.  

If you got some knowledge about stockmarket history, this investment is typical what Cisco did with some client like ICG Communications.  
  
In the fact, Open AI is losing money and are not expecting to get money before 2028. So, Nvidia make an investment of 100 billion to allow them to buy the chipset. Yes, Nvidia makes a ""loan"" to his client because they don't have money. Cisco did the same

In AI business, lot of people make a big investment in data center because they've got money like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon ... but Open AI doesn't have the money. 

And what happen to ""cisco capital"" ? lot of companies declared bankrupcy during the .com crisis because the expected yield had never come. And Cisco will never get back the money.

He is lucky to make that kind of profit at all. It seems the market didn't expect aapl to do as well as they did because usually these changes would already be priced into the premium. I am honestly confused why that didn't happen because aapl is relatively stable and it shouldn't come as a surprise that the stock goes up slow but steady.

I see no logical reason why OP got such great returns here. It's very likely that any stock increases are already priced in and you can't sell the options so they'll expire worthlessly. Most of time you'd probably be lucky to merely break even where it's just barely in the money so you get your initial investment back but nothing else.

That's why I never tried buying calls. You invest 20 grand and if you're lucky at all you'll break even or make a small profit instead of losing it all.

 Netflix 2011: The Moat of Momentum

In 2011, Netflix’s competitive edge didn’t come from original content — that would arrive years later — but from its **massive licensed library** and **subscriber infrastructure**. While media giants still viewed streaming as experimental, Netflix had already aggregated content through broad licensing agreements, creating a one-stop destination for viewers.

Competitors couldn’t simply replicate this advantage overnight. To build a rival service, a studio could digitize and re-encode its own catalog for internet delivery, but the result would be a narrow, single-studio offering. Worse, the technical costs of on-demand bandwidth in the early 2010s were prohibitively high, making the economics unattractive without an existing subscriber base. Netflix had that base — paying users, predictable revenue, and working distribution relationships with ISPs.

This combination of **content scale, infrastructure, and early-mover subscriber loyalty** gave Netflix a moat that delayed serious competition until deep-pocketed rivals like Disney and Amazon eventually committed billions to catch up.

# Duolingo Today: A Parallel Challenge

Duolingo in 2025 finds itself in a situation that echoes Netflix’s 2011 moat. It may not own all the “content” (languages are universal), but it has something equally defensible:

* A **massive user base** built through years of gamified learning.
* A **global brand** synonymous with fun, accessible language learning.
* **Data and AI infrastructure** to personalize lessons at scale.
* Deep relationships with learners (and even institutions, through the Duolingo English Test).

Live translation apps are like the “media giants” of Netflix’s era: they have technical capability and resources, but lack a comparable **network effect**. They can offer instant utility — like a studio streaming only its own shows in 2011 — but they don’t yet provide the structured, addictive learning experience Duolingo has refined.

The risk, of course, is that just as Disney+ eventually disrupted Netflix by combining vast content ownership with streaming scale, big tech platforms (Apple, Google, Meta) could erode Duolingo’s moat by embedding **translation + learning** into everyday devices.

# The Takeaway

Netflix survived and thrived because it **pivoted into original content** before competitors could commoditize its model. Duolingo faces a similar inflection point: it must **go beyond basic lessons** into immersive learning, culture, and hybrid translation-learning experiences before live translation becomes “good enough” for casual users.

Its early start, brand loyalty, and data advantage are real moats — but, as Netflix’s story shows, moats only hold if you keep deepening them before rivals catch up.",Significant_Papaya28,-2,,,2025-09-23 04:39:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nl8km0/duolingo_dd/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nl8km0/duolingo_dd/nfpf0sn/

nfojkje,comment,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Best trade of my life,"You can absolutely lose money. Options are more complicated than shares as there's a lot of mechanics that go into the price. You're right in basics that each options represents the ability to buy 100 shares of a stock at a given price. So this call lets OP buy 100 shares of Apple at $230. When you buy it you pay a premium for the ability. OP paid $414 for the right to buy 100 shares of apple at $230.

  
You can buy and sell the option anytime before the expiration date, but the price will go up and down relative to the share price, at a really basic level just scaled because it represents 100 shares. But it's way more complicated than that because the value of option will change.

The short is you'll gain more money if the price goes up (to a point), and you'll lose money as the price goes down (also to a point), than just owning shares.",wentwj,3,,,2025-09-23 01:09:19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnoawe,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nnoawe/best_trade_of_my_life/nfojkje/

Since they signed a contract to buy each AAPL share at $203/share on 10/22 no matter the price, and at the time of close out each share had risen to (currently sitting at) $255/share, that’s an automatic profit of $52/share.

Its harder for them given a significant number of products emerge from China direct or rerouted through a third nation e.g. Vietnam. It just depends on how serious the admin is on enforcing the tarrifs.

1nnlj24,post,france,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"MacBook Pro M1 – écran défectueux sans choc, Apple invoque la malchance","Bonjour à tous,

Je partage ici mon expérience avec Apple, après **plus d’un an de tentatives infructueuses** pour faire reconnaître un défaut matériel sur mon MacBook Pro 16 pouces M1 acheté neuf le 02/02/2022.

Ce Mac a été très peu utilisé, toujours manipulé avec soin, et affiche une batterie à 100 %. Pourtant, début décembre 2024, l’écran a soudainement présenté :

* Une ligne verticale ultra fine scintillante sur le côté droit croisant une ligne horizontale ultra fine scintillante en bas avec 3 points blancs ou jaunes au croisement

Le SAV Apple a immédiatement proposé un **remplacement d’écran à mes frais (près de 1000 €)**, sans diagnostic des pixels, malgré l’absence de choc ou de défaut logiciel. Réponse : “c’est la faute à pas de chance”.

J’ai contacté Apple Irlande, envoyé un **courrier recommandé avec accusé de réception**, et reçu un appel me répétant la même chose : pas de geste commercial, pas d’explication technique, pas de réponse écrite.

Cela fait **plus d’un an que j’envoie des mails en France et en Irlande**, sans jamais obtenir de réponse écrite ni solution concrète. C’est pour cette raison que je publie aujourd’hui mon témoignage ici, pour rendre ce problème visible et recueillir des conseils ou des témoignages similaires.

Merci à ceux qui pourront m’aider. Je ne peux pas faire de capture d'écran car les lignes scintillantes n'apparaissent pas sur la capture d'écran",vanille34mtp,0,0.15,19.0,2025-09-22 14:47:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1nnlj24/macbook_pro_m1_écran_défectueux_sans_choc_apple/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1nnlj24/macbook_pro_m1_écran_défectueux_sans_choc_apple/

🔸 Monday: Volatility was low and volume is around the 20-day average during the first 3 of the week. Before the session, Trump said shift to six-month corporate reporting cycle. This would save money and improve management. The stock market opened slightly higher. In the session, Nasdaq extended gains and reach the 1%. The stock market closed higher. 🟢

The stock market closed slightly lower. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Nvidia agreed to buy $5B stake from Intel and then Intel jumped more than 25% in a single day. The stock market opened higher. Trump said stocks will do much better as time goes by. Russell 2000 index hit 2,450 level and its all-time high from November 2021 and November 2024. It's a good sign for the momentum separated to all stocks for a long time. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time high. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Trump asked Supreme Court to let him Fire Fed's Lisa Cook. The stock market opened mixed. Also, Friday was Triple Witching day which occurs quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Triple witching days can cause a spike in trading activity. As result, volume was highest level for last 5 months. Trump and China talked about TikTok. Trump made a call with President Xi of China and he said very productive and appreciate the TikTok approval. As result, Oracle gained more than 4%. The stock market closed higher and completed the week at all-time high. 🟢

The first rate cut is done. We could see two more cut in this year because labor market data revision damaged to Fed confidence. The next Fed meeting is in November. The probability of 25 point rate cut is 92% in CME FedWatch Tool. On the other hand, M2 Money Supply are supported to lower inflation. Russell 2000 reached to all-time high again after a long time. The stock market rally could continue in the nice period.

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""*implausible,*"" but that ""*Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now—in an attempt to preempt potential rivals—is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.*""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""*\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons—that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.*""

Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

For instance, if you bought a share for $100 and sold it at $200, you would owe taxes on your $100 in capital gains. If you passed the $100 stock (now worth $200) to your heir and they sold it, for tax purposes, they would not have had any capital gains.",elitepigwrangler,2,,,2025-09-19 21:16:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nkyy6t/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nkyy6t/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/nf4fro9/

1nl8km0,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Duolingo DD," Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

nf39lgi,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Sep 19, 2025",When I knew nothing about investing I dumped a ton of my money into AAPL after the covid crash and just hoped for the best. I have been tempted so many times to pull that money out but it’s still in there and it’s caused Apple to be a hugely disproportionate part of my portfolio. Definitely a good problem to have but I still don’t know what to do with this money hahah,d-ronthegreat,2,,,2025-09-19 17:52:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nkyy6t/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nkyy6t/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/nf39lgi/

1nl1f0l,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",auradragon1,111,0.89,56.0,2025-09-19 13:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/
1nkyy6t,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Sep 19, 2025","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1njcfnv,post,wallstreetbets,AAPL,Apple Inc.,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.
