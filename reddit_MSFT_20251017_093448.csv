1o8cw2k,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline (most people are focusing on interest rate cuts, but ignoring this fatal truth)","The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month, but Powell's statement last night is the real bombshell, signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction. Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.

Balance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults. When the Fed sells mortgage bonds, it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings. When it sells Treasury bonds, corporate bond issuance costs also rise. This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity, which requires closer scrutiny. History always repeats itself. On the eve of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn't stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero. Ultimately, it was the initiation of Q1, or reverse balance sheet reduction, that stabilized the financial system. In his speech yesterday, Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets. This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019, when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10%, nearly shutting down Wall Street. He's clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake, and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment. On the surface, the US stock market is still rising, but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants, which together account for over 32% of the S&P 500's weighting. The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium-sized businesses are struggling with financing costs. This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate, but the patient's hands and feet are already cold. Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy. Even more subversive, halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic. When the Fed expands its balance sheet again, it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar. This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash. He didn't rush to cut interest rates back then, but instead directly injected liquidity into the market, successfully stemming the spread of the crisis. Powell's approach is now precisely the same. For businesses, this is an even more life-or-death situation. The Treasury Department issues $1 trillion in bonds every quarter. If the Fed stops selling them, it effectively lowers the government's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, giants like Apple and Microsoft, with $800 billion in cash on hand, will be in for a rude awakening. Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash, and the money they hold is quietly evaporating. So, when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts, remember the deeper meaning behind Powell's move, as quoted by Dave Reifsner, Director of Research at the Federal Reserve.

A famous governance maxim: When interest rates hit rock bottom, the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon. This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game. Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight; halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall. This move today will undoubtedly upset some. But it must be said. In the financial world, the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay. Remember, on the night of October 15, 2025, when history turns, some will hear only the wind, while others will see the shape of the storm. Now it's your turn. Are you one of the 97% who are focused on interest rate cuts, or the 11% who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction?

Is the top of this Pyramid Nvidia? 

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.

  
Plus is ... the US Government taking a stake in private companies? Is this really going to help? I know US did not pay any money, but isn't the shareholders diluted?

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

1o18pxg,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

**My Position:** November, December, and January calls + shares. Planning to add more, as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks. I'm using my gambling account, and I got permission from my wife's boyfriend to use her account and start another position.

1o0ja1l,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$POET - Someone Just Dropped $75M In and Won't Say Who (We Find Out Oct 17),"Alright so I've been digging into this POET Technologies thing because of that dumb fuck who keeps posting shit about them in the DDs so I said what the hell I'll take a look.

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

1nysepn,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$RGTI is a scam stock,"Most retail investors have NO IDEA what they own. They see quantum in the name and buy. Even though these businesses make no revenue, no profit, and have no growth. 

For example: https://x.com/martinshkreli/status/1974488176325738784?s=46 (this post got around 1m views over the weekend exposing them) 

$RGTI The Reality Check: Revenue and Margins Collapse

On paper, Rigetti is doing what every moonshot tech company does telling us about the future. But in the present, the numbers don’t inspire much confidence.

🔹Revenue dropped 41.6% last quarter.

🔹Gross margins halved from 64% to 31%.

🔹The expiration of the National Quantum Initiative funding hurt results (though there’s a chance Congress renews it).

The CEO sold ALL of his shares at $12 a few months ago. He owns no direct shares. 

They only did 1.7M in revenue last quarter and they are trading at a 15B+ market cap. 

To its credit, Rigetti raised $350M through an ATM offering, pushing its cash pile to $572M. That’s enough runway for a couple of years, but it came at the cost of heavy shareholder dilution.

In other words: Rigetti has breathing room, but not without watering down existing investors.

This stock went up like 25% last week because they sold 2 computers for 5 million dollars. Its valuation is insane. They will almost certainly dilute stock holders so they can raise $ for their incredibly capital intensive business. 

Please be careful and don’t fall for “hype” 

There is no business, or way to success for $RGTI. 

Please buy companies with good growth, and solid fundamentals like $AMZN, $MSFT, etc and let pigs get slaughtered. 

They will tell you it’s going to keep going up but it’s just to pump their bags.

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA.

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

1nirgbf,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

1nesqr3,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"DD on $BITF - A Speculative, But Undervalued Company with the Potential to be the Next Big AI/HPC Infrastructure Play","Hello fellow regards,

I am writing to you to inform you on the next best degen ticker for the most restarted regards. No financial advice here buddy, invest at your own risk. 

Before we get into Bitfarms (1W +70%, \~$1bn Market Cap) it is important to get some context on the current AI Infrastructure landscape.

* Nebius just struck a $17.4b deal, potentially rising up to $19.4b, with Microsoft to provide dedicated AI infrastructure over the next 5 years. Nebius rose 40% over the last week. Additionally, Q2 Revenue is up 106% quarter over quarter.
* CoreWeave, not my favorite play, but has $30.1b in revenue backlog and contracts with Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, and others. CRWV is up 187% since their IPO in March.
* Oracle has signed a $300b deal with OpenAI. Q2 cloud infra revenue is up 52% year over year. Oracle rose 38% over the last week.

This is just the start. There isn’t enough compute to go around, hence the high revenue backlog and exorbitant amounts of CapEx spending.

Now, where does BITF come in? This is supposedly just a BTC mining company. They have a proven capability of running profitable BTC mining data centers – their direct cost per BTC is $48.2k while their revenue per BTC is $98k (an almost 50% margin per BTC).

I want to start by introducing the key risks before getting to my main investment thesis:

* What BITF don’t have currently is commited contracts/backlogs.
* Additionally, there is an execution risk (obtaining power, permits, building cooling, fiber, ensuring reliability, acquiring GPUs or equivalent hardware, hiring skilled staff).
* BITF has diluted shares in the past, but has completed a 4.9m+ share buy back.

So, I want to be clear, this is a speculative play for the most restarted regards. However, I do believe these risks will all be addressed.

Now moving on to my bulll thesis:

They have demonstrated a clear willingness to shift their focus towards AI/HPC infrastructure. I introduce the Panther Creek data center campus in Pennsylvania. 

* Pennsylvania is well known to be a haven for data center development. They are home to the PJM Interconnection (covers electricity market for 13 US states), so huge amounts of power at competitive pricing. Pennsylvania also generates tons of natural gas, nuclear and coal. In essence, PA offers abundant, low-cost energy, existing transmission, and favorable permitting as well.
* The Panther Creek DC is expected to have between 350 – 410 MW with full capacity expected to be reach by 2027.
* T5 Data Centers is responsible for the buildout. This is a well reputed company in this space with 3 GW+ managed, 100% uptime since 2012, and 50+ data centers supported.  
* In addition, they have secured additional prime data center land (Bitfarms Moses Lake Site) in Washington located in the largest data center cluster on the West Coast.
* Another key point is they have significant access to financing ($230m in total liquidity) to make this high CapEx spend a reality. $8m in monthly FCF generation – this is almost $100m yearly and equivalent to almost a third of revenue.. Furthermore, they have secured $300m in debt from Macquarie (a bank focused on infrastructure finance). Also, they have their future non-core business of BTC mining to support CapEx spending.
* It is a value play – yes, you heard me right. Yes, this stock also went up 70% over the past week. But BITF presents signifcantly lower multiples than comparable peers.
   * BITF with 2.9x TEV/Revenue LTM compared to CLSK (6.33x), CRWV (23.59x), IREN (8.65x)
   * TEV/Revenue NTM (next 12 months) at 1.65x for BITF compared to CLSK (3.31x), CRWV (9.95x), and IREN (3.36x)

Can BITF 10x? Yes, it can. Can BITF go to bag-holder land? Yes, it can. Invest at your own risk.

Have fun

Regards,

checazzo

1ne8vin,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure” was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**.

[The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the “**Begin Actual Construction**” definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn’t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council’s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there’s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren’t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA’s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

1nddyqw,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025,"Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet.

Still, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling.

**Cloud revenue ratio**

* Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio
* Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \~11.5–12×

**Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)**

* Company | Market cap (we’re using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR
* CRWV | 48B | \~$4.85B | \~9.9×
* NBIS | 22.9B | \~$0.43B | \~53×

To be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave.

With that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's.

It doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract.

Now, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.

The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.

This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.

Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.

**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**

* Phase | Year | MW | Notes
* Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted
* Phase 2 | 2026 | \~100 | contracted
* Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap

**Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's**

* Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr
* CRWV | $1.213B | \~470 | \~$2.58M
* NBIS | $105.1M | \~40–55 (use 50 midpoint) | \~$2.10M (range \~$1.91–2.63M)

https://preview.redd.it/5pcgvchk4cof1.png?width=2616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddfce7ea4f21947704c643845420b095a1eb2c7

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE’25 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

This is not financial advice or advisor.

1n9ijrj,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,It's time for Broadcom to replace Tesla in the Mag 7,"After the most recent earnings report yesterday, including outstanding guidance, it's clear that Broadcom needs to be added to the Mag 8. Or even replace Tesla in the Mag 7.

With respect to net income (first graph), Broadcom still lags Nvidia, Apple, and the four hyperscalers. However, it generated $18.9 billion in net income last year to Tesla's $5.8 billion. While both are given rich valuations (P/E ratios of 122 and 208), Broadcom's income streams are projected to grow exponentially while Tesla's have been contracting; while Tesla is projected to turn a corner, but unlike the other Mag companies, they consistently miss on street expectations, even as these expectations constantly get guided down.

As far as price action, Tesla richly awarded its shareholders many years ago. But since being added to the S&P 500 nearly five years ago (second graph), it has severely lagged the broader index and trails all of its peers except for Amazon. Meanwhile, Broadcom has consistently rewarded its shareholders with nearly 7x returns in less than five years, handily trouncing all of the Mag 8 peers except for Nvidia.

How about for year-to-date? Again (third graph), Broadcom is the leader at +32.66% YTD. Tesla brings up the rear at -10.74%.

Like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, Broadcom is also a high margin tech company that fits the AI theme, with Apple also now making an entry into this space. Tesla is a low-margin automotive company with a high margin energy credits division and a highly speculative robotics play.",Prudent-Corgi3793,394,0.95,44,2025-09-06 00:07:34,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9ijrj,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1n9ijrj/its_time_for_broadcom_to_replace_tesla_in_the_mag/

1n4wvy8,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Nvidia’s top 2 mystery customers made 39% of Q2 revenue, up from 25% last year, raising concentration risk concerns","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html)

Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele.

“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter.

“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

“We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both “direct customers” and “indirect customers.” Customer A and Customer B are listed as “direct customers.”

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. They’re companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia’s mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an “AI research and development company” contributed a “meaningful” amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company’s AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and “neoclouds,” which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for “sovereign AI.” All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia’s revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

“As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,” Huang said.",callsonreddit,1630,0.96,259,2025-08-31 16:58:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n4wvy8/nvidias_top_2_mystery_customers_made_39_of_q2/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n4wvy8/nvidias_top_2_mystery_customers_made_39_of_q2/

1n2ccop,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,What % to have invested in one stock,"Hi all. About ten years ago when I was still a college student, my family member, who was a financial advisor, invested some of my money for me in various stocks. He invested my money for a few years, then passed away, and I've kind of held on to the money, more or less without moving it, ever since. One of the stocks (Microsoft) has done far better than all of the rest, so now something like 20.4% of my investments are in Microsoft (which is not how it was when I started). I'm wondering whether the advice for a stock like Microsoft under these circumstances would be to sell some of it to diversify, and if so what the conventional advice would be on how much to sell?

1mx6g1o,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,95% of AI businesses are not making money with AI ...,"Hi,

You've probably heard about this study showing that the vast majority of companies investing in AI projects have no profitability. But is that shocking in itself? Not really. During the Gold Rush, many invested heavily to go find gold in the American West. They bought licenses, tools, paid workers, etc. And in the end, very few made a fortune with gold.

But this study reminds me of the dot-com crisis in the 2000s, which we largely overlook because we focus more on 2008, as it was more brutal for the economy. But in the late '90s, the internet was emerging. People said it would revolutionize our lives, and it did. A ton of companies bet on the internet to attract investors. It became mandatory to have "".com"" in your logo to show you were part of this revolution. At the time, we saw companies like Microsoft, IBM, and other tech firms riding the wave to prominence. But one stood out: Cisco. It was breaking all records on the stock market. It was the ""Nvidia"" of the internet.

However, it became clear that companies banking their business on the internet weren’t making any money from it. They offered services through the internet, but no revenue was generated from this revolution. We saw massive investments from these companies but absolutely no revenue to justify those investments. That was the dot-com crisis. We watched companies with their "".com"" branding vanish.

And the company that was hit the hardest was Cisco, to the point that, even after 25 years, Cisco still hasn’t recovered its pre-crisis stock price. In the end, a ton of companies disappeared, whether they were search engines, e-commerce sites, chat platforms, or internet providers. And year after year, the market rationalized. There’s one main search engine, one messenger that takes off, then gradually social networks emerge, and so on. People stopped talking about the internet itself and increasingly focused on the services it enabled.

Today, we’re seeing something similar. Companies have replaced "".com"" with ""AI."" We’re seeing companies starting to explain that their services have reached a limit in terms of revolution (ChatGPT) and that now, we’re moving more toward gradual evolution over time. And maybe now is the moment to take stock and see if OpenAI and other companies are starting to become profitable. So perhaps we’re reaching a point where there will be a shakeout in the AI market, where some companies will have to justify their investments.

* Governance candy for CFOs and compliance trolls.

**Translation: “Please don’t call us RPA, we’re your brainstem now.”**

# The Competitive Bloodbath:

**These guys at UiPath picked a fight with literally everyone.** 

**Automation Anywhere** – Same deck, slightly different colors.

**Blue Prism** – Still cosplaying as the safest option in town.

**Microsoft** – The real boss fight. Power Automate + Copilot bundled into Office for pennies, and “good enough” steamrolls “best-of-breed” every time.

**Appian** – BPM hipster, selling “process fabric” to execs who like words more than results.

**AWS/GCP** – Don’t even pretend. They’ll give you a bucket of Lego APIs cheaper than UiPath’s premium orchestration babysitting.

UiPath’s only moat? Dev love and breadth. Weakest point? The AI Units tax. CFOs paying for idle GPUs like they’re Pelotons in January.

# Why It Matters:

 **The market’s bifurcating:**

**Integrated all-in-one platforms (UiPath, Automation Anywhere).**

**Composable ecosystems (Microsoft, AWS, GCP, Appian).**

UiPath has to justify its price tag vs. “free with your Microsoft license” or “roll-your-own AWS toolkit.” That’s a suicide mission unless Maestro delivers serious ROI.

# Scenarios: 

* **Bull:** UiPath lands Fortune 50s at scale, ARR re-accelerates, multiple rerates like it’s Red Hat for AI. Stock doubles or triples from optionality alone. 
* **Base:** Keeps enterprises that need orchestration across SAP + Salesforce + legacy + AI. Growth stabilizes mid-single digits. It muddles through. 
* **Bear:** Microsoft bundles Power Automate into everything, AWS/GCP commoditize orchestration, CFOs riot over AI Unit bills. UiPath slides into irrelevance as “expensive macro recorder.”

# Catalysts: 

* Fortune 50 Maestro case studies.
* ARR growth troughs then ticks up.
* Hyperscaler alliance.
* Predictable AI Unit pricing.

# Risks: 

* CFOs mutiny over GPU burn.
* Sales inefficiency grows.
* Microsoft’s distribution crushes them.
* Still seen as “RPA vendor” with delusions of grandeur.

# Bottom Line: 

UiPath is priced like it’s already dead. That’s the margin of safety. At 3–4× ARR, you’re not paying for a win; you’re paying for the chance they survive long enough to prove Maestro is more than a PowerPoint trick. If they pull it off, you get rerating upside. If not, you don’t lose much, because the market never priced in victory anyway.
