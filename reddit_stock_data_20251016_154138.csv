TBH, I think you are going to see the US economy slowly start to crater, mass unemployment, soup lines, Trumpviles on the outskirts of towns, while the market keeps hitting new ATHs. We are going to see Fed cuts and maybe even QE... There is so much liquidity and cash in the market from the Boomers and 401ks, along with the advent of easy retail investing, that it's going to be completely detached from reality or fundamental values. There is no better place than the US markets for returns, so the line goes up and to the right... until suddenly it doesn't, but the wealthy/Government won't let it totally burn, we'd go to war with China before we'd let this market take a -30% shit.",0o0o0o0o0o0z,1,,,2025-10-16 15:24:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o8281v/brace_for_impact/,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o8281v/brace_for_impact/njsix39/

Any help would be appreciated.,"24K to 36K represents a 4.8% to 7.2% spread in yield. The lower end is relatively doable, the higher end you start running a serious risk of not keeping up with inflation.

I’d avoid CC ETFs, their payouts are a function of the asset price so if the market takes a 50% haircut then your income does too.

BDCs and MLPs can certainly goose income but they have limited inflation protection. So you still need enough income growth to keep up with inflation.

You still need a bond/HYSA buffer to smooth out the lumpy payments. Assuming a 25K per year income you’d need about 15% (75K) of your portfolio in cash to draw from and that would provide 3-5 years of income protection.

Here’s a quick example:

75K in a SGOV paying 4% = 3000

150K in SCHD paying 3.9% = 5850

150K in SCHY paying 4.1% = 6150

100K in PBDC paying 10.5% = 10500

25K in Cash paying 3% = 750

Grand Total = 26250 (5.2% yield) or ~2200 per month.

Assuming bonds, BDCs and Cash provide zero inflation but SCHD/SCHY grow at 8%, then your average growth rate is 4.8% which should keep you ahead of inflation. As your income grows faster than inflation dial down the PBDC and increase the amount in the dividend growth positions.",CCM278,1,,,2025-10-16 15:15:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o83if5/new_to_all_this_so_please_dont_laugh_i_only_have/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o83if5/new_to_all_this_so_please_dont_laugh_i_only_have/njshcdt/

It does matter which parties are invovled, be it the same or different.

All of the silly examples of people talking about their chairs or Monopoly are not examples of real economic activity.

I am an NVDA shareholder - it makes me an owner with a stake in the company.  I have purchased an NVDA GPU to put in my PC.  My PC is running Windows OS.  I'm also a MSFT shareholder.  Uh-oh - is this illegitimate or fake business?  What if I used my dividends from MSFT to buy Windows OS and my dividends from NVDA to buy my GPU?  I just paid them back with their money and nothing happened right?  Wrong.

The dividends paid out are off their books.  I could have used the money to buy anything else or save it.  But I used it to buy their products, which they collect a profit margin on.  Had a non-shareholder/owner/stakeholder made same purchase of GPU and OS, NVDA and MSFT collect same profit margin.  Again it does matter who the parties are as long as an economic transaction occurred.

Now take the example of MSFT using its own Windows OS and Office for their employees, and NVDA using their own GPU's for their desktops and workstations - in this case th product is all contained within the same company.  They did not pay themselves for it, and there is no revenue recorded.

When MSFT buys stakes in companies, it is very small/marginal, no board seats, they are just a shareholder like everyone else.  Do you know most successful corportions have a capital investment arm?  They invest in both private and public equities - I mean this has been going on for decades.",greenpride32,1,,,2025-10-16 15:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/njsf9l9/

njsf3xo,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,New to all this so please don’t laugh. I only have 500k. I just need to make $2000 to $3000 a month in dividends to help secure my retirement. Any help would be appreciated.,"Some controversial ideas but hopefully helps.

**Annual, not monthly**

If you are looking to generate $30,000/year in income and you have $500,000 in capital, that is a 6% yield. That's what you should be targeting. Don't try to replicate a paycheck. It leads to poor decision making. 

At this point, *you* will need to manage your cash flow. You'll need to budget, spend carefully and wait for income to come in from your investments. There is no magic bucket you can place $500K and get a monthly growing paycheck without having to worry and have your principle safe. It's fantasy. 

Most dividend stocks pay quarterly, bonds pay annual or semi-annually and there is a small subset (like REITs) that pay monthly. Most investments you can access *do not* pay out monthly. Products that promise to do so are replicating it. Not actually earning it monthly.

**Safety of Principle**

If this $500K is the bulk of your retirement savings, safety of principle should be one of your main criteria for investing. You'll likely need it for a long time.

Reaching for high yield products tends not to qualify.

**Where to find 6%**

The unfortunate answer is that, right now, it is not widely available. Some REITs perhaps that are large and well managed can do it and be safe enough. There might be some companies in the financial space.

But stock prices are at all time highs. Higher prices means lower yields. Just the way the math works.

**Possible Course of Action**

1. Keep your money (for now) in short-term treasuries/CD's etc, until you figure out what to do
2. Start looking for dividend paying companies that are financially secure. There might be some ETFs or funds that focus on income and are well managed.
3. Don't chase high yield products. If treasuries are pay 3% - 4% annually, and a product is promising 14% monthly, it should immediately raise a red flag. 
4. Set yourself up for a part-time job. If you think you're going to get pushed out start angling amongst people you know to secure a part-time job. Maybe you got a friend that works at Home Depot or something. Talk to the manager. Whatever. 

Think about it this way - if you can very safely earn 4% on Treasuries that's $20,000 a year on your $500K. That means you just need to earn another $10K - $15K per year doing some small part-time gig or side job or whatever. I don't know what your trade is.

I appreciate this might not be ideal at your age/health but it's better that reaching for yield and risking your life savings when markets are at record highs. 

Just an alternative opinion. Hope it helps.",ifinance674,1,,,2025-10-16 15:02:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o83if5/new_to_all_this_so_please_dont_laugh_i_only_have/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o83if5/new_to_all_this_so_please_dont_laugh_i_only_have/njsf3xo/

1o859gk,post,eupersonalfinance,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,ESG ETFs that aren't tech/AI-focused,"Hi all. I have inherited some money in the Isle of Man and am deciding how to invest it. I don't need the money to live off so it will be purely an investment for the future (10 years or so).

The specific requirements I have that are making it a bit more challenging are that I mainly want to invest in sustainable/green/ethical companies, and I want to avoid tech companies involved in AI (apart from medical tech AI which I'm okay with). The AI thing is because I don't want to invest in tech companies that use AI in the creative economy. I found Defiance Large Cap ex-Mag 7 which excludes the top 7 major tech companies so that seems ideal.

After quite a bit of research what I am planning is the following:

VanEck World Equal Weight Screened UCITS (TSWE) - 40%

iShares MSCI Europe ESG Enhanced CTB (EEUD) Accumulating - 40%

Defiance Large Cap ex-Mag 7 ETF (XMAG) - 20% (If I can purchase as a non-EU and non-US citizen)

Then I'm debating reducing some of the percentages above and maybe adding in:  
Vanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX) ((If I can purchase as a non-EU and non-US citizen)  
  
If I can't purchase any of the US-based ETFs then I will replace those with:  
iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD)

How does this spread look considering my specific investment requirements? I know all the potential pitfalls of ESG investing but I'm happy to earn less money in the long run in order to stick to my personal ethical and moral values.",thetogorian,2,1.0,2.0,2025-10-16 14:49:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o859gk/esg_etfs_that_arent_techaifocused/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o859gk/esg_etfs_that_arent_techaifocused/

Any help would be appreciated.,"Not really.  Most dividend growth etfs pay qualified dividends.  Qualified dividends aren't taxed until you make more then $48,350 for an individual or $96,700 for a married couple.

  
If you use some Nuveen muni funds such as NZF paying 7.5% as your bond allocation you pay zero taxes.

  
Cefs paying dividends thru ROC (return of capital) are untaxed on that portion of their dividend.

  
SCHD, DGRO, VIG, etc, all pay qualified dividends.",Apart-Leg-8077,1,,,2025-10-16 14:44:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o83if5/new_to_all_this_so_please_dont_laugh_i_only_have/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o83if5/new_to_all_this_so_please_dont_laugh_i_only_have/njsc2np/

Also, if you are buying apple products you are more likely to have higher disposable income, which makes the cost less of an issue. For me in Ireland that’s not even half of my daily wage.

Any help would be appreciated.,"If it was me, and I was planning for retirement, I would buy safe companies that are household names. Bury the money in something that isn't some obscure speculation or hype job.

With 500k, you could make 2k-3k.
Verizon 6.7%; PFE 7.0%, BP 5.76%, UPS 7.79%, and Ford 6.38%

On the low end, BP at 5.76% is $28,800 per year, or $2,400 a month.
So spreading out between these 5 will net you over $2400, and you can reinvest the excess to gain a little more over time.

Also as a side note, dividends aren't often monthly; it will be quarterly, so plan on 3 month intervals of payment.

Also note that it doesnt specifically have to be dividends.

Then look up the joys of fixed income In regards to stocks.  I particularly like the book  Income Factory by Steve Bavaria for this.  There are other books similar to this like by Seligman.  These books extol the magic of living off dividends for your Retirement, the magic of compounding,  and also the concept of total return on stocks.

The goal of making $2k to $3k per month or more is very doable.

njs7q7v,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"I saved €15,000 and not sure what to do with it. I need some investment advice","There are three ways to look at this:

(1) If you want to try to make good money at the risk of loosing everything, concentrate: take three companies's stocks that you like ($5000 each), hold them for 3/5 years minimum and hope for the best. If you are lucky you may end up with 500% (see Netflix or Amazon or Nvidia in their golden age), or 0%.

(2) you create a diversified, mixed portfolio that will protect your wealth: % is subject to your own risk appetite, but let's say that you could do 60% in stocks (30% S&P, 10% Nasdaq, 20% EuroStoxx 50, or eventually mix and match with a bit of China, Japan and others) and 35% in bonds (20% in US Treasuries with short duration, say 1 to 3 years as they are not very sensitive to changes in interest rates, and 15% in longer-dated Treasuries, say 7 to 10 years, to protect you in case of recession) and 5% in gold. Add bitcoin to the mix (2-5%) depending on your appetite for crypto.

(3) you delegate 10-30%  of the static asset allocation as per point 2 to tactical funds that move for you, as markets conditions change. Some are famous (such as the SPDR Bridgewater all weather ETF) or the PIMCO all asset funds, while new ones emerge using AI to understand markets in real time, such as Pantarai ADAPT.

Points 2 and 3 are wiser than point 1, but they will generate a stable 7/10% CAGR over the long term that will make you wealthier if you stay invested for the longer term.

Point is is go big or go home.

That's the nice thing about an io standard port that also does charging.

njs7dlr,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,RIP $ABAT,"Fellas, call me crazy, but I think it's important to look at the facts here and consider what the real objective of investing is. Now obviously everyone invests in a stock with the hopes of making a short term or long term profit, but it's important to remember that these companies we're investing in need to have our full faith to complete their visions of the companies future. Stocks are like the OG GoFundMe, except we the investors gain from the donation too. Now here's how this looks to me. The company is in a very volatile stage of their development with less than desirable net returns on their investments. This made them an interesting stock, hence the explosion in their price given all the positive press. Now obviously when people start to see the stock drop so much and hear about this grant termination (that's being appealed), the instinct is the sell out of fear of possible losses, but why? Now more than ever, American Battery Technologies is in need of it's investors, everyone is trying to play the market and predict where the stock is going or saying that the stock was overinflated anyway, but I think it's the opposite. This second recycling plant is supposed to generate over 1000 jobs and be capable of recycling and refining over 100,000 tonnes of battery material annually, well dwarfing their first facility. On top of that they're wanting to do all of this domestically, which will assist our domestic market with battery recycling and manufacturing during a time when electric vehicles and equipment is more prevalent than ever. If anything, I believe this stock is undervalued. I like ABAT's vision and goals, they seem like the kind of stock that can turn into a long term power house of a company, but investor faith is a big thing. Our buying and holding of their stock isn't just about our profits, it's about helping THEM fund their plans, so that eventually they can make their profit, and in turn we'll see even greater returns. If they plan on continuing with this factory and this vision regardless of the grant then I say we outta blow this stock up even higher and help them out, since that's the originally purpose of the stock market, not just throwing money in for a couple months and pulling out when the going gets tough. Plus honestly I wanna stick it to those inside traders, the stock went down by almost $3 in the span of 10 minutes yesterday and I watched the whole thing thinking ""that's absurd!"". ABAT deserves better.

njs7d3r,comment,europe,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple removes charger from European Macbook’s,"Yeah this sucks for some people but other people like me have been collecting USB-C chargers. When I bought my first Apple Macbook with USB-C in 2016, I bought a secondary 87W USB-C charger. Now almost 10 years later and two more Apple Notebooks, I have 2 x 87W, 1 x 96W and 1x 140W USB-C Apple chargers. All four of them charge a Macbook just fine. Also my dock that I use nowadays can charge with 90W. So I basically have more than enough chargers. If I buy new macbook and it came with a charger I would just thorw that charger to the other unused chargers.

I know that other people circumstances might be very different and they always sold/gave away the charger that came with older devices. But I think with USB-C it is no longer needed to consider charger and device as pair. It also allows competition for chargers. And a lot of chargers are cheaper than Apple's offering.

Your post would make sense if NL was Switzerland, with low income taxes and a wealth tax.

Except the NL income taxes are among the highest in the EU.

And let's not pretend people with truly obscene or generational wealth are affected, they'll optimize it easily. So this tax is intended to punish exactly those i mentioned - high income first generation earners.

Since the main home is excluded from those taxes people are also blowing up the housing bubble, which can't be good.  
  
Also for high earners it's very difficult to retire in the country, and you'll see a lot of those people move to other countries because of the EU freedom of movement.

We most likely had some things to settle regardless involving the ongoing semi weakness that we had going into this year and thanks to that, a move down to 5400-5500 SPX was likely undodgeable. From there, I suspect it bottoms and then moves slowly to 6500-6600 on the year.

I know it’s not gonna be popular ‘round Reddit, but this was a bad market setup for anybody with the S&P having pulled back to back +20%’s.

1o82bav,post,france,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Essayez le vélotaf !,"TL, DR : Essayez d'aller au travail en vélo pendant une semaine si c'est physiquement possible.
Et oui, si tu bosses à 80km de chez toi, ce post ne te concerne pas...

Je me suis mis au vélotaf (aller en vélo au travail) il y a 3 ans.
Depuis je fais 24 km/1h de vélo presque tous les jours... Et c'est génial !

Comme beaucoup de monde j'utilisais la voiture pour aller au travail, horraire de bureau standard, donc là où ça ""bouchonne"" le plus. 

J'ai commencé pour des arguments écologiques et santé (sport). J'ai continué pour le bien être que ça m'apporte. 

Au début j'avais commencé un peu quand il faisait beau, à mon boulot précédent (plus proche : 5km allé). Mais dans ma tête c'était pas possible toute l'année. ""Quand il pleut c'est pas possible"". Puis j'ai vu un reportage sur les Pays-Bas et un intervenant disait ""ce qui est dommage en France, c'est que le vélo c'est estival, alors qu'au pays-bas, c'est toute l'année.""
Je me suis dis ""si eux peuvent, alors qu'ils ne doivent pas avoir une météo franchement meilleure que la mienne, alors pourquoi pas moi ?"".

Entre temps j'avais changé de boulot et j'étais à 12km maintenant. Je me suis dis que le cap à passer (full vélo) serait un peu dur, donc j'ai acheté un VAE d'occasion et des kway. Et c'était parti. L'objectif c'était minimum 4 fois par semaine. Maintenant je vais au travail seulement une ou a deux fois par mois en voiture (des mois pas du tout) quand je n'ai ""pas le choix."" Au bout d'un an j'ai acheté un beau vélo parfaitement adapté à mes besoins (Orbea CARPE 10). Ça fait 3 ans que je fais 4000 km/an.

Et honnêtement, maintenant ça me fait suer quand je dois prendre la voiture. Ça roule mal, les gens font n'importe quoi. Alors qu'en vélo je suis tranquille sur ma coulée verte. 
Si j'ai passé une journée de merde au taf et que je suis énervé, en voiture je bouillonne, je suis à fleur de peau. En vélo, je met quelques coup de pédale bien fort et après m'être défoulé je suis détendu.

Après j'ai des conditions quand même favorables : parcours quasi plat, coulée verte sur 80 % du trajet, entre les arbres et une rivière.
Mais énormément de personnes bossent à moins de 5 km de chez eux (ou à peine plus) et ne le font pas.

La météo ça se gère, un bon kway et la pluie c'est juste sur le visage. (D'ailleurs il pleut souvent, en nombre de jours, mais pas forcément toute la journée, donc souvent on passe entre les averses).

La seconde question c'est la transpiration. Et en vrai ça se gère. Déjà le fait de faire du sport régulièrement, on transpire moins (et on ressent moins l'effort). Et puis surtout, ne pas partir trop couvert ! À 10°C, j'ai ma chemise et un pull, pas plus sinon je fini trempé. Le plus important c'est un cache-cou pour pas attraper froid à la gorge et des gants pour les mains qui ne sont pas actives. Le reste du corps se réchauffe en pédalant. 


Alors j'ai pas abandonné ma voiture pour autant (parce que déjà je peux me permettre financièrement de la garder même si je l'utilise ""peu""). Qu'elle me sert également à aller voir mes proches et partir en vacances. Et puis dans quelques situations je vais l'utiliser pour aller travailler :
- Si je suis un peu malade (genre pas au point de me faire arrêter mais suffisamment mal pour pas avoir envie de forcer),
- Si il y a un vrai risque de verglas (pluie puis gel ou pluie verglassante),
- Si j'ai un rendez-vous juste derrière qui fait que j'ai besoin de ma voiture.

Par contre, si vous vous mettiez au vélo, par pitié, acheter des lampes et utilisez les ! (Et pas des trucs clignotant, surtout à l'avant).

Info en vrac : J'habite en Picardie, pas la région la plus réputée pour une météo clémente (Pluiecardie)
Je mets 20 min en voiture, 30 en vélo. Quand je rentre le soir j'ai perdu que 20 min dans le transport mais j'ai fais 1h de sport.
J'ai perdu 4 kilo en me mettant au vélo.
Je me sens beaucoup mieux physiquement, ""capable"".
Apprendre à entretenir son vélo soit même c'est super. Essuyer et graisser un peu sa chaîne (mais pas trop!) une fois par semaine et regonfler ses pneus une fois par mois c'est déjà pas mal et ça permet de faire durer les composants bien plus longtemps.

Gold is at all time highs, silver is following, CH02Y is negative, oil is down, yields are down, volatility is up. I am no rocket scientist, but it might be time to call BS on this rally. The collectibles rally is long over. Retailers are deeply down, unless they announce some sort of OpenAI partnership. Luxury is down. Automakers are down. Consumption is weak. Prices are rising. Households are strained. The labor market is contracting, with fewer hires, which is usually the step before layoffs. I cannot find a single reason why this market should still be going up.

They say “don’t feed the bear,” and it is true that predicting when or what will trigger the reversal is difficult. But the interesting part is that it is no longer about *if*, the market *will* go down.

Every day I am in front of a screen reading charts and news, listening to interviews. And all I hear is talk of bubbles and of the OpenAI financing schemes, where a company burning 2B$ a day somehow invests hundreds of billions through share swap or circular credit structures. Eventually the music will stop, and someone will be left without a chair.

Maybe this time winter really is coming. It is impossible to predict the exact culprit, shadow banking, private credit, non federal currencies, trade wars, but one thing seems certain: AI is the only thing holding this market up. The real economy is cooked, but the stock market has not realized it yet. And when you look at tech company balance sheets, they are undeniably impressive, but maybe, just maybe, they are too good to be true, reflecting a circular spending spree that has yet to translate into real returns.",yngmsss,117,0.84,71.0,2025-10-16 12:09:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o8281v/brace_for_impact/,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o8281v/brace_for_impact/

njrmohk,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I bought QQQ in November of 2023. It has doubles since then: sell or hold???,"Questions for you:

\- Do you see the world becoming less or more digital and tech driven?

\- Are you ready to short it?

\- Do you have in depth understanding of a deep value play that could offer a higher return (VFC, INTC, EL, etc) and are you comfortable taking company risk on top of market risk?

Points to think about:

\- TQQQ has gone up 250% from your entry, despite the 60% drop earlier this year. Are you confident you can catch the bottom again or was it luck? If the former, a leveraged play has offered a substantial reward for the extra risk in the past, but the latter is much more likely to be the case.

\- If you had gotten in at the ATH in 2021, it would have taken 1100 days to recover the losses of 2022.

\- The FED seems inclined to cut interest rates and start QE. That means extra liquidity hitting the market in the next few months, which is likely to go towards the end of the risk-on spectrum.

\- REITs as suggested by some seem to be a waste of opportunity when compared with SPX with which they seem to be highly correlated, despite a beta below 1 ([https://www.morningstar.com/funds/best-reit-etfs-buy](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/best-reit-etfs-buy)).

What I was trying to say is that although these 2 companies are priced at a reasonable comparable price per share (180 vs 230), what really differentiates their market cap is the total outstanding number of shares in their case, not the earnings or the price/share. As far as I know NVIDIA has like 25B of total shares, compared to like 1.6B of AMD.

1o80cnx,post,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),CARA margin of safety solver,"Hey, I am working on a margin of safety solver. Short intro to how it works: first I run a Monte Carlo DCF for stock A. The resulting distribution is the payoff of A at time T and captures our uncertainty. Next I define a benchmark portfolio B with a growth rate and a variance using geometric brownian motion, so its payoff S\_T is lognormal. I set risk tolerance gamma based on net worth and target exposure size. Given A\_T, S\_T, and gamma, I solve for P\* via CARA utility indifference.  
  
Interpretation: buying one unit of A is equal in utility to buying P\* worth of B. Hence we get a benchmark and risk tolerance anchored margin of safety. Market risk is already handled in the DCF discount rate; P\* prices the residual model risk.

Anyone interested in this as an Excel or Google Sheets or Google Colab template?

How do you assess margin of safety?

Anyone using utility indifference pricing for other applications aswell?",SignificantMixture42,2,0.75,5.0,2025-10-16 10:06:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o80cnx/cara_margin_of_safety_solver/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o80cnx/cara_margin_of_safety_solver/

It might not seem like a lot but you have it its there and you have enough to come up with a good solid plan. This is not financial advice but what I did was I put my money in a good stable growth fund and studied every wild post where someone hit it big on a short term trade. I then started trading high risk options every day on paper writing down everything. You will find that you need a lot of luck to hit that big runner and if that's all you are looking for you might not ever grow your account.

Step 1 put your money into a solid fund that's making you money while you study I like SGOV

Step 2. Pick one stock and learn everything about it I use SPY

Step 3 read every post where someone hits 5k in one day on 0-DTE spy options and understand it.

Step 4 Use an options watch list and enter a paper trade in the morning that you feel is going to hit do this for at least 3 months.

Step 5. look at the charts! Go back and review all charts for every trade that hit and know or at least have a good understanding of why that trade worked. Pro tip you will start to find that some people are posting lies about their big 10k hits the charts wont lie like photoshop will on WSB's

Step 6. Remember 0-DTE is gambling unless you have developed a certain skill set over lots of trading. Risk only 1-5 percent of total account value for 3 more months maybe 6.

Step 7. You might never hit a 10k trade in one day but 40 $250 trades over a year with good risk management is very possible.

* Financials react to sentiment but rarely get materially hit

njr425j,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,What’s gonna happen if the shutdown drags on?,"Government default on its debt, mass lay offs, closures, and system wide collapse of ""non essential"" government functioning.
Of course, the $100bn federal paramilitarized police force with its network of extrajudicial detention facilities all over the country are categorized as essential, so that keeps getting funded, even though US soldiers aren't. States are then forced to massively raise taxes or massively cut services. Widespread social unrest met with extreme violence by ICE, the National Guard, the military, and police. Emergency cancellation of the 2026 election and perhaps a declaration of suspending the federal government entirely until the crisis is over, effectively ending the United States' experiment in a Democratic Constitutional Republic just in time to celebrate its 250th anniversary with a massive show of military force.

Of course, some variation of this is also something like what I expect the Trump Administration to attempt if the government doesn't stay shut down. The main difference being that the dismantling of the fed will be less abrupt and more a weakening by ignoring whatever they don't like followed by ignoring whatever court cases they don't like followed by the public accepting that nothing means anything anyway.

The supreme court has leaned toward the executive branch to the extent we could be a long time in limbo government shutdown.

So far that fact has not dawned on investors even though they are headline sensitive.  So far the bull market remains intact with the government overspending, the US treasury functioning with its own version of QE and the Fed stuck with no new data to change its direction.  

The last few days of volatility has be headline driven as well as driven by the usual fall season of profit taking and re-investment.  Bond returns have been semi-stable and gold has continued its run upward while crypto is now moderating.  Credit and debt is not at a critical level.

1o7yfof,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Account recovery (600 -> 17k) thanks to tariff-driven volatility and LEAPS,"Ive been down about 15k since 2020 madness after chaining some terribly timed trades when vaccines were coming out with short-term calls. Account was dormant for years. Come liberation day and that massive drop in April I bet the 800 or so left in my account on LEAPS assuming there’s no way this admin is going to let the market go to shit hyping up the “golden age”, plus devaluation of the dollar forcing money to continually go to equities. I chose GOOGL and NVDA mainly at first, NVDA was way less far out (expiry in July) because the premium was still expensive for my little account, the GOOGL contracts were Jun 2026 expiry. NVDA rebounded pretty quick and I used the proceeds from that to divest into a bunch of other random stuff (see screenshots) that I saw getting hyped in random threads, basically gambling and got lucky it worked out. GOOGL I held for a while but at one point it was such a massive gain that I sold and replaced with a smaller footprint, that is still the largest gain I’ve had to date from any trade ($555 to $4700). Lots of SPY trades for not a lot of gain mostly because I was hedging volatile times along the way with weekly calls/puts (especially over weekends and FOMC meetings where things felt dicey).

I’ve since converted more than half of my portfolio to shares but still have some random LEAPS where I found DD interesting and the risk/reward was appetizing, mainly for LAES as of late. Im holding Jan 2027 LEAPS that are up 800% in like a month, will prob trim that and roll into some other LEAPS.",castcoil,60,0.9,18.0,2025-10-16 08:00:53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7yfof,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7yfof/account_recovery_600_17k_thanks_to_tariffdriven/

I think there’s definitely positive developments based on the MACD and accumulation of the last few months. Major institutional money wouldn’t pour into the stock in such a critical sector for a massive nothing burger. 

Seems too well executed to be purely happenstance. They would’ve let it go to $20 in this stock market environment if they wanted to really pull some money from the broader market. It was already parabolic enough to accelerate those gains.

njqt33w,comment,wallstreetbets,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,YOLO: $28k in pre-revenue HOND,"I’ve looked into both OKLO and HOND, and I don’t get how anyone can call HOND the “safer” play. Terrestrial Energy’s molten salt design sounds great on paper- efficient, high-temp, low-pressure… but it’s still pre-commercial and years from deployment. Their own timelines push first power into the **early 2030s**, assuming no delays (which is optimistic in nuclear).

Oklo’s in a different stage entirely. They’ve already broken ground at Idaho National Lab, have multiple DOE pilot awards, and are targeting first power by 2027. Their design is based on the proven EBR-II reactor that ran safely for decades, and they’ve got a DOE HALEU fuel award with testing underway at Argonne.

Financially, Terrestrial’s merger brings in about $280M- not bad, but not much for a company a decade from generating revenue. Oklo’s sitting on over half a billion in cash, has government-backed contracts, and partnerships with Switch and Equinix. They’re vertically integrated too, so once their reactors are online, they’ll earn recurring revenue directly.

The valuation gap isn’t a mistake- it’s the market pricing in risk. Oklo’s $26B cap reflects its head start, DOE backing, and 2027 timeline. Terrestrial’s $4B makes sense given how far behind they are. The idea that it should 7x to “match” Oklo ignores that Oklo’s already executing while Terrestrial’s still in pre-licensing.",C130J_Darkstar,2,,,2025-10-16 06:32:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7t81o/yolo_28k_in_prerevenue_hond/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7t81o/yolo_28k_in_prerevenue_hond/njqt33w/

njqheet,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,My method on making money trading mispriced options with AI,"I think the comment you replied to has a point. The OP's ""step 1"" is incorrect because they learned about Black Scholes and stopped learning. Everyone in the industry knows BS is wrong but useful. The OP then assumed deviation from Black Scholes is due to greed/mispricing. That's not right. BS is just a model, like you said. And there is no correct implied volatility, like your said. So there's no way you can use BS to say there is mispricing with any confidence as it's an incorrect model being used to price something that can't be described consistently by its own assumptions.

BS doesn't account for skew which is a limitation of BS, not an indication of trader greed. You need a local volatility, stochastic volatility, or jump diffusion model to account for skew -and those models work pretty much perfectly for pricing while including skew. They are q-measures, so they have to fit the pricing data as is, but they don't necessarily have predictive value.

I think the OP might have a good strategy, but not for the reasons they think they do. They are basically taking advantage of undersold/oversold opportunities and regression to the mean. They aren't finding mispriced options that deviate from a pricing model. 

What they want to do is say that prices deviate from their p-measure's expected value, but they only use q-measures as if they are p-measures, which isn't logically consistent.",maqifrnswa,15,,,2025-10-16 05:04:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7prtk/my_method_on_making_money_trading_mispriced/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7prtk/my_method_on_making_money_trading_mispriced/njqheet/

njqf0f9,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,$DNN + DoD Meeting (Oct 23) = 💰💰💰 The Easiest DD of Your Life.,"Hey, congrats, your post was referenced by ChatGPT.

I could not find any credible public evidence that **Denison Mines (DNN)** is confirmed to be participating in a meeting with the “Department of War” (or Department of Defense / related U.S. government body) later this month.

Here’s what I found and how I interpret it:

---

### 🔍 What I found

* There is a Reddit post claiming that “the Department of Defense is hosting a major conference on Thursday, Oct 23, and one of the key agenda items is the nuclear fuel cycle as a national security imperative” and that “a project like Denison’s … is exactly the type of project the U.S. government is looking to support.” ([Reddit][1])

  * This is speculative commentary by retail investors, not a formal announcement or verifiable source.

* Denison’s own public statements (e.g. on their website or in recent SEC / regulatory filings) do not indicate any upcoming scheduled meeting with a U.S. “Department of War” or DoD function. (Their filings focus on mining operations, environmental permitting, taxation, etc.) ([Denison Mines Corp.][2])

* I did not locate any press release, regulatory filing, or mainstream news article confirming that Denison is slated for direct involvement in a DoD conference or meeting as of now.

---

### 💡 My assessment

It’s possible that Denison or uranium-industry players more broadly could be invited or tangentially involved (e.g. via panels, contractors, or as part of broader strategic policy discussions), especially given the rising interest in nuclear energy, critical minerals, and supply chain security in U.S. policy. But absent any concrete confirmation, it remains speculative.

If you like, I can dig into recent government agency schedules or FOIA / meeting notices to see if there is any formal agenda listing Denison. Do you want me to try that?

I currently have my Roth IRA with Wealthfront and i have been happy with them for the past 8 years. They rebalance my account automatically and have allowed me to hold up to 10% of my account in crypto ETF's(Bitcoin & Ethereum). Wealthfront also has other tools like Life Path where they can make projections on where you will end up based on your current investments, etc. I just think the 3% on the Transfer(which for me is close to 2700$ and then when you add in the 3% match on contributions($210) is a big draw. The problem i have is I just don't like the interface of Robinhood and it doesn't seem like they have any Asset allocation-based tools like Wealthfront has. In addition, I have also built up strong referrals over the years & have my money at Wealthfront managed for free. My questions to everyone here are the following: Do you have a Robinhood IRA? Do they allow you to invest in crypto ETFs like IBIT and ETHA? If yes, do they cap that? How do they display your asset allocation? Is it easy to rebalance?",sravenzz82,0,0.44,3.0,2025-10-16 04:23:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o7uh7h/decision_on_moving_roth_ira_from_wealthfront_to/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o7uh7h/decision_on_moving_roth_ira_from_wealthfront_to/

1o7u8u1,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,INTC earnings coming up,"Been in this stock for a long time, so let’s chart this long-term descending channel on the daily since that $62 top, and finally!!! we’re seeing price break back toward the upper resistance trendline. The move from $17.67 to $37 has been massive, nearly a 100% recovery inside the same pattern that’s been holding for years.

You’ve got the EMAs (9/21/50/200) all stacked bullish now with the 9 EMA curling above the 50, and MACD crossing positive recently, momentum looks real though. RSI is around 65, so there’s room before we hit overbought, but we’re getting close. If this keeps grinding, that 40–42 zone is going to be the key test… that’s right at channel resistance and where sellers could step back in.

Now with earnings coming up, this setup gets tricky. They’ve been trying to flip sentiment on INTC with all the fab expansion news, but the actual numbers and guidance will decide if this breakout holds or fades.

If I were to play options here, I’d look for something slightly out of the money but past earnings, maybe 40C for mid-November or December, giving room for a continuation run if it breaks out. For a more defensive angle, I’d go 35C for November 21 ***not a financial advice*** closer to current price but still with some time to capture post-earnings momentum.

No puts for me right now unless it rejects hard off $40 and confirms weakness… this looks more like a setup you buy the dip on, not short. Hope this helps you make a decision.

1o7t81o,post,wallstreetbets,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,YOLO: $28k in pre-revenue HOND,"Positions: 500 shares and 25 Nov calls that I bought at the top this morning :/

https://preview.redd.it/7zhgb4vgldvf1.png?width=2136&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ced687ae99dfbf789bb43874f83c05f84719a4c

So if you’re anything like me, you haven’t made much money from buying companies that actually make money. Well, I’m finally capitulating and degened into a pre-revenue stock that I spent researching for less than 3 hours; it’s called Terrestrial Energy (HOND). Think of it as OKLO, but with way lower market cap and needs way less money to get it going.

**TLDR**

The play is riding momentum on a company that burns less cash and sits at a significantly lower valuation than OKLO. Less to lose, more to gain. If you want to keep reading to feel less like a regard, carry on.

•Terrestrial Energy (TE): Doesn't build the nuclear plant; Vendor/licensing model keeps capex low and is relatively low-risk due to its <1B market cap. Uses standard LEU fuel. Regulatory progress is solid (Nuclear Regulation Commision + Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission milestones), validating their tech and design .SPAC merger coming like its 2021, $280M cash in hand. Won't have plants online until early 2030s. 

•Oklo Inc.: Uses HALEU fuel, which is hard to acquire. Builds and operates their own plants = massive capex costs, but has potential to make more income. Valuation is insane baffling. Timeline is aggressive (\~2027–28 first deployment).

**Fundamental Technicals: Jargon that I don’t understand**

**TE**: IMSR Molten Salt Reactor

TE uses IMSR is basically the lovechild of Oak Ridge lab research and “how do I make this cheap and simple” engineering. Their tech uses molten salt coolant which allows for high temperature (\~400°C+) at low pressure, which means you don’t need the huge, expensive containment vessels that normal nuclear plants do. Their design has a huge bump in efficiency: about 50% better than conventional LWR plants. Their plant will be large enough to replace grid power and provide industrial process heat. That’s a big deal because industries like chemicals, metals, hydrogen production, and data centers all need high-temp heat. Other SMRs just can’t do that. The core is modular: sealed, replaceable, integrated vessel. This simplifies construction, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning. The “three uniques” TE often brags about:

1. High-temp heat for industrial cogeneration (efficiency for generating electricity and heat)
2. Low-pressure operation = simpler plant, lower CAPEX
3. Passive safety = physics handles decay heat

One big advantage TE has is that it uses standard Low Enriched Uranium (LEU). That’s huge. It is very easy to obtain compared to OKLO’s Highly Enriched LEU (HALEU). TE already has Centrus Energy lined up to secure the uranium.

**Oklo**: – Aurora Liquid Metal Fast Reactor

Oklo went a completely different route: fast reactor, metal-fueled, sodium-cooled. Small, decentralized microreactor. They probably have better tech than TE, but the engineering challenge is much more complex: sodium reacts violently with air/water, so balance-of-plant design is tricky. As I stated, OKLO requires HALEU (5–20% enriched U-235). Supply chain is thin, and the Department of Energy support helps, but it can still be a bottleneck. However, they can recycle their fuel, which offsets some of the challenges of acquiring fuel.

**Business Models**

TE uses a licensing and servicing biz model – other companies build the reactor while TE makes recurring revenue through IP and licensing over the lifespan of each plant. After the spac merger, they will have $280M to fund their operations until the plants go online. Oklo on the other hand, is vertically integrated. They finance, build, and operate reactors themselves, which will give them full control, potentially bigger margins. However, they will need to spend a lot to fund the construction of their intial plants. OKLO in turn has more cash on hand (over 500M), and they could probably raise more cash without much dilution since their market cap is so large.

**Regulatory Paths: long multi-year process**

TE has been able to get approval steadily

Their approval with the US and Canadian nuclear commission agencies validate their safety and design thus far. However, the big downside for TE is that their first commercial plants are expected to go online in the early 2030s.

Oklo hit a regulatory speed bump back in 2022, but they did bounce back quickly, and got approved after 15 days. Anyways, OKLO is giving aggressive guidance, planning on being operational in 2027-2028, which is way earlier than TE

**Valuation** They both don’t make any meaningful revenue now, but look at their market caps. Need I say more?

You can decide for yourself after reading about the quality of LLMs (chatgpt, Gemini etc) on https://quant.stackexchange.com/q/76788/54838?

These models are quite poor when it comes to handling data or summarizing complex material meaningfully. It's frequently unreliable and incoherent responses that you cannot use. Even worse, you wouldn't even be able to tell if a response is garbage as an inexperienced user.

For example, Devin AI was hyped a lot, but it's essentially a failure, see https://futurism.com/first-ai-software-engineer-devin-bungling-tasks

It's bad at reusing and modifying existing code, https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/03/22/is-ai-making-your-code-worse/

Causing downtime and security issues, https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-generated-code-outages/, or https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622

Trading requires processing huge amounts of realtime data. While AI can write simple code or summarize simple texts, it cannot ""think"" logically at all, it cannot reason, it doesn't understand what it is doing and cannot see the big picture.

Below is what ChatGPT ""thinks"" of itself [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/4a1c8cda-7083-4998-aca3-bec39a891146). A few lines:

* I can't experience things like being ""wrong"" or ""right.""
* I don't truly understand the context or meaning of the information I provide. My responses are based on patterns in the data, which may lead to incorrect or nonsensical answers if the context is ambiguous or complex.
* Although I can generate text, my responses are limited to patterns and data seen during training. I cannot provide genuinely creative or novel insights.
* Remember that I'm a tool designed to assist and provide information to the best of my abilities based on the data I was trained on. For critical decisions or sensitive topics, it's always best to consult with qualified human experts.

Right now, there is not even a theoretical concept demonstrating how machines could ever understand what they are doing.


Therefore, LLMs (and reasoning models) generate false, misleading, or nonsensical information that sounds convincingly plausible. The IV vs HV response is a perfect example for that. 

Nick Patterson explains that Rentec employs several PhDs from top universities just for data cleaning in [this podcast](https://www.thetalkingmachines.com/episodes/ai-safety-and-legacy-bletchley-park), starting at 16:40, the part about Rentec starts at 29:55.


Even if the answers were always correct, you can take the argument further and say that you cannot rely on tools and data everyone else has access to if you try to do research or want to find something that generates profit. That's what [Graham Giller](https://www.gillerinvestments.com/about) refers to in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUmRQCC61Vw&t=623s

Long story short, relying on machines is extremely dangerous if you don't know much about the subject yourself.",AKdemy,2,,,2025-10-16 03:08:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7prtk/my_method_on_making_money_trading_mispriced/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7prtk/my_method_on_making_money_trading_mispriced/njpz68c/

Other examples of ""round tripping"" have been pretty blatant and concerning. This purchase (Microsoft) along with other funders, purchasing a data center company, is needed. If you've been following the news around MSFT you'd know that Microsoft data centers can't keep up with the demand for compute and inference requests. They've been scrambling to expand their existing azure data centers, and they've been scrambling to lease capacity from data centers also. 

This seems pretty straightforward. Microsoft found a data center company to buy. NVDA being connected to the funding however, this could be a round trip transaction for them, if they somehow get revenue back from this data center Corp in the form of buying more overpriced GPUs. 

These other examples of round tripping have been pretty bad though.

That sums up the idea quite nicely.

It's also interesting that you're seeing a low win rate but overall profitability in your results. As you said, it's early on the results side of things, but I find it intriguing in terms of psychology as well. I notice that most traders seem to gravitate toward high win rate over high rewards. I suppose it is going to vary with the individual but I can certainly see how the large wins would make up for not just the monetary losses but also the mental hit of setting up a losing trade. It might be hard for a less experienced trader to appreciate the subtle difference here between gambling results that also have high risk/reward compared to having a thesis for this skew setup.

1o7prtk,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,My method on making money trading mispriced options with AI,"TLDR: Find stocks with abnormal volatility skews using AI, then trade Vertical Spreads on them depending on the direction. 

I've been trading options for about 3 years now. For basically all of that time, I was essentially gambling. Buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns.  Lost money, made some back, lost it again. The usual retail trader shit. 

About 6 months ago I got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. Slowly I began to build my strategy and with the help of AI I can confidently say that I am getting pretty profitable now. More importantly though, I finally feel like I have a decent understanding behind the options market. 

This is a post I wish I had when I began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy I currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. Feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. 

# 1. What is a volatility skew (and why does it exist)

Think of options pricing like Vegas setting NBA Finals odds. Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.

Here's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.

**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.

**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic buying puts or FOMO'ing into calls, you get an abnormally rich skew. That's what we're hunting for

[SPY's actual volatility skew vs Black-Scholes, u can see that far OTM options are way more expensive than theory predicts](https://preview.redd.it/63asxmkkmcvf1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=63752679f5b11a3385943891529bd4e7c3e0d452)

# 2. How to find options with rich skews?

Not all skew is created equal, as i mentioned earlier, most skews are totally normal and are usually well priced. The key is having a system / criteria that helps you identify richer/abnormal skews more consistently. 

**Note: before you start prompting the AI, you wanna make sure that it has real upto date market info.** To do this either use one with the market data plugged in like Xynth, or download it from TradingView or polygon and then upload the CSVs to ChatGPT or Claude, either method should work. 

Here’s how I look for them 

**A) Skew Z-Score Below -2.0**

* This compares current skew to the stock's historical average. A z-score of -2.0 means the skew is 2 standard deviations steeper than normal, statistically rare and more likely to revert. In simple terms: how outta pocket is the current pricing of the current chain compared to historical averages

**B) IV/RV Mismatch**

Compare the current IV vs the RV, realized volatility ie, what the market thinks the stock will do vs what it has been doing lately:

* **OTM strikes:** IV should be significantly HIGHER than realized vol → overpriced
* **ATM strike:** IV should be equal or LOWER than realized vol → fairly priced

When both conditions hit, you've got one option that's expensive and one that's cheap. That's your spread.

**C) Momentum Confirmation**

This tells you which direction to trade:

* **Positive momentum + call skew** → Buy call spread (buy ATM, sell OTM call)
* **Negative momentum + put skew** → Buy put spread (buy ATM, sell OTM put)

https://preview.redd.it/gpijsbnuqcvf1.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=80865a05d5f9f6b0f2fa21a1e918aa3e552288f7

# 3. The Trade: Vertical Spread

Once you've identified rich skew, here's how what you wanna setup, i mainly only do bull spreads cus i dont like shorting but is suppose you can try the opposite just as well:

* **Buy the ATM option (fairly priced, \~50 delta)**
* **Sell the OTM option (overpriced, \~10-25 delta)**

https://preview.redd.it/v30wttkcrcvf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=53cb57bd141bb2a9a207d8f73a2049a62bceacc4

[These visuals are examples from my Xynth chat. In this particular trade, the score was only 68\/100 mainly because the ATM option was already overpriced, so the spread doesn't give us much profit potential. Nonetheless, the concept remains the same. Feel free to adjust the variables in the prompts and expand the scope to run this scanner daily or even hourly on many more stocks.](https://preview.redd.it/o5jua1vfrcvf1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d380bae0bb9a98500e6eec6bd6c3e1cfb766cb4)

# 4. Why Vertical Spreads?

If you've read this far then you probably realized that the point of this strategy isn't purely directional but rather a relative value play, which is a fancy way of saying **you're buying something cheap and selling something expensive at the same time.**

You're not just betting the stock goes up or down. You're betting that the pricing relationship between two options is out of whack, and it'll normalize. 

Plus, if the stock does something crazy, your long option protects you. You're not exposed to infinite risk on either side.

# 5. Results

I've been running this strategy for about 2 months now, so take these numbers with a grain of salt, it's still early.

**Current stats:**

* Win rate: \~38%
* Average return per winning trade: \~250%
* Average loss per losing trade: \~60%
* Net: Still up overall despite losing more trades than I win

The nature of this strategy is asymmetric.  I've had trades return 300-400% in a couple weeks, and I've had trades lose 50-70% just as fast. But winning 4 out of 10 trades at 3-4x return covers the 6 losses easily.

I’ve heard all this trash talk about Robin Hood, When it comes to my Roth IRA I would like to start it asap but I want my Roth money to be in a reliable brokerage 

I’m a bit lost because Robinhood has a friendly approach to a beginner like me into this world of stocks and it’s a UI I’m use to and familiar with but at the same time I’m a bit concerned with all these points people have made against the app 

Fidelity seems like the OG that will never do you wrong

njpa5bl,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Best point raised so far. Amazon is diluting, while Apple is continuing to decrease the share count.

However this is not an issue because Amazon is a growth company for one. Apple is not. They are stagnant. Apple is a cash cow & just ploughs all their funds into buybacks. Short sighted.

Amazon could do exactly the same but prefers to push the envelope. The past 5yrs they have invested $455B more into R&D & capex than Apple...

You also have to factor in that Amazon has used stock for M&A.

Only point is Bezos unloading some stock but it's not exactly material. He's sold $16B this year but the average daily trading value is $10B.

And what do you know? The stock went from $41.85 July 24, the stock trailed down after a big late-mid month spike as it usually does down to $35-$36 and then what do you know like a month later it went to $46, and then ATH $60 ish the past couple weeks.

If you know the patterns of how a stock trades + pay attention to the news (good and bad) you’ll know if its real FUD, a shakeout, or over/underhyped. 

$ABAT caught real momentum that was suppressed the second it could’ve gone parabolic. It’s healthy long term, but if you aped in the last week you’re very much discouraged from buying back in.

My thesis revolves around the aerospace/drone vertical which is far more relevant now vs what it was 5-, 3- or 2- years ago. In 2024 US military additive manufacturing spend surged massively (166% year-over-year), as compared to any prior year, which correlates to the ramp up in drone manufacturing and record high aerospace backlogs... and correlates to SSYS's stock price starting to trend up (the SP bottomed in 2024 and has more than doubled now).

njp2ql4,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Do you think 2026 will be a bear market or an extension of the current bull run?,"I think we'll have a year where growth slows, as a lot of current high valuations require perfect execution. Some companies will manage to hit or exceed those high targets, while others flounder. I think it'll also be a year where a lot of companies frankly won't be able to implement AI well and there's not really as big a return on investment in this early cycle of AI implementation. 


I think the AI bubble will deflate a bit rather than explode, as the big players fall slightly short of expectations and there's more investment than return on AI for a lot of Fortune 500 companies.


Also a new emerging market will appear...

njp2o7x,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"I once used a collar around a very large appreciated stock position which saved me a lot of taxes by holding the gains forward into more advantageous tax years, and eventually even saved me from big losses on the downside when the remainder of my position dropped below the put strikes in 2022. I only use the strategy rarely though, because it really only makes sense for tax purposes.

I mostly just sell a few CCs when I feel IV is highly overstated on a stock I consider fairly stable, or buy long calls when I feel IV and upside potential is greatly understated on a company or sector.

For the most part, my portfolio is buy and hold, because I found after years of options trading, that it's ultimately a zero sum game and only makes sense in specific situations where one strongly disagrees with the market or has a specific tax or risk situation to deal with.

njoxpp1,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Do you withdraw monthly or yearly?,"When you recieve a pay check your employer has already takes some of that money and payed an estimated tax to the IRS.  They don't know your total income from a second job or investments.  they also don't know what tax deductions you typically claim.  So your employer is only estimating your taxes.  And you are allowed to tell your employer to pay more or less.

then in april when you file the your yearly taxes if you payed too much in i taxes you get money back from the IRS.  If you didn't pay enough you owe additional money.  And if you owe a lot of money you may also pay a penalty.

So if he overpaid by 1K that means he can expect to get 1K back from the IRS.  Keep in mind no one knows exactly how much money they will owe at the end of the year.  So in So after december all investments must submit forms to you that IRS and your  how much you made and what ammount is taxable.  your employer also totals up all the money you earned and what taxes they payed to state and locale taxes.

1o7nr0u,post,stocks,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Colocation centers for efficient data center infrastructure is the next boom cycle (case study of CORZ),"There is a little know business model called Colocation Centers that will certainly be a boom cycle. Ill explain what it is then use CORZ as a case study of a company who will crush it in the next 5years. 

Per Gemini:
""A colocation center (often shortened to ""colo"") is a type of data center where a business leases physical space to house its own servers and other computing hardware""

Simply put, a colocation center houses the data infrastructure for large tech companies and the market size is expected to be $200Bn in 4-5years (in terms of generated revenue, and probably 50* when you consider PE ratios of the companies that will be the colocation centers in the future). The market cap of the companies housing the data infrastructure should be in low estimate of $10Tn.  

You might think NBIS and CRWV are colocation centers, but they are not, and they instead sell their consulting and operational services to big tech in exchange for managing and deploying the contracts for actual colocation centers (such as Equnix, Digital Reality, Cyprus one, and CORZ).  

Market research clearly shows the outsourcing on data storage centers away from big tech and towards colos. 

Colos are necessary since they optimize energy use, control, host cosmic ray shielding, and are centered around major power supplies (which is why stocks like nuclear are taking off). The energy demands will be massive. 

CORZ are switching their entire business model towards colos and they are a relatively new, unheard of, and low market cap player in the space. They have plenty of experience hosting digital asset mining (which is where they generate the bulk of their revenue). 

CORZ presented at the last Web summit (the latest tech conference who have a strong focus in data instrastructure) and they blew away the big tech players with their energy efficiency models, rapidly changing business model. I personally witnessed this, and they had many big names introducing themselves. Expect huge partnerships and growth from this small $6Bn market cap player.

* on peut se dire qu'ils sont quand même sympa Google (trolling face)

1o7mplv,post,investing,META,Meta Platforms Inc.,Ways to recover from bad (Crypto) investments?,"Greetings!

After having reviewed some threads from this sub, it seems like no one really likes the 'Oxford Income Letter' peoples.  After having had them for a while, I do not like it either, as having followed their advice, I lost out on a couple of windfalls (Ford's stock from $4/share to $10), and currently have lost 99.83% of a crypto investment.

They have the ""moonshot"" crypto recommendation from Andy (Manward Press and etc...).  I was, and still am, naive about crypto, and purchased this moonshot token (Vee / Vee Finance) and put $1,050 into it at $0.01/coin. expecting I could potentially make a pretty penny.  Right now the coin is at $0.000018/coin.

Should I just hold onto this coin and hope it improves, or try to find a way to dump it?  
Originally bought through gate-io before they kicked all US customers off, and gate-us is still not operational yet after a few years.  Only other place I can find to offload it is through an interchange I've got connected to MetaMask, but it says I don't have the gas to get the coins over there.

So I'm basically looking for some advice on what I can do to try and re-build myself financially.  I thought the daily/weekly/monthly dividend stocks would be a great place to start, just don't have the funds to just cut and run to it.",_Usually_Muted_,0,0.41,29.0,2025-10-15 22:46:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o7mplv/ways_to_recover_from_bad_crypto_investments/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o7mplv/ways_to_recover_from_bad_crypto_investments/

njokpwb,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"It seems as though the US is really going to dig in to trade war escalations leading up to the ""meeting"" with China. April all over again?","Once the focus shifts from all rare earths to just the Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs), China's position morphs from temporarily dominant to near-absolute monopoly, accounting for more than 98% of global extraction if Myanmar is included and a near equivalent share of separation capacity. This is not a market distortion that can be easily fixed by building more processing plants in the
West. Without viable deposits, investment in processing is somewhat irrelevant. In this sense, Deng Xiaoping's remarks understate the level of control and dominance that China has over the rare earths that matter. The only other known material sources of HREEs sits in regions bordering China in Myanmar, which holds 10-15% of known global HREE reserves (and all of their output is processed in China). There is no clear historical precedent for this scale of control over a strategic asset. A few examples that come to mind are De Beer's control of the diamond trade in the 20th century or Sudan's control over Gum Arabic, a key input for soft drinks-but neither commodity has anything approaching the same strategic or geopolitical value.

People can talk all they want about Lynas this or Mountain Pass that. Here's what those companies have to say:

Lynas 2024 Annual Report. ""The Company continues to investigate opportunities to secure alternative sources of Heavy Rare Earth feedstock. However, global availability is limited, with most supply originating from ionic clay deposits in China and Myanmar.""

MP Materials 2024 Annual Report: ""While the Mount Pass facility produces separated Light Rare Earth products such as NdPr, our planned Heavy Rare Earth separation capabilities will still depend on feedstock imports. Current non-Chinese supply is negligible, making global heavy rare earth supply chains highly vulnerable to geopolitical risk.""

njojvvr,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I bought QQQ in November of 2023. It has doubles since then: sell or hold???,"Look I think the best basic approach is boglehead. 

Any other setup should be compared to that and only done if you have a strong reason to do so. You had a strong reason, it paid off, and now you dont have a strong reason to continue. Perhaps start taking profits and send that money back into a boglehead style setup. You will still have plenty of exposure to AI, but it wont be over the top exposure. 

I would probably roll the entire thing into a bit of voo and some bonds etfs if you dont have any of those. Seriously most people should have some kind of bond ladder going even if its small. When a market downturn happens those bonds are usually a golden ticket while the rest of your portfolio is in the dumps. 

We can debate how much of your portfolio should be in that kind of stuff, but having none of it is usually betting everything will work out really well. The reality is that there will always be a downturn coming. It could be months, years, or decades away, but when it happens equities usually suffer a great deal for a period of time. If that bad period runs long and happens during the beginning of your retirement it will be ugly. 

If I was you I would look at your entire portfolio and compare it to a boglehead setup and ask how far apart are you from that. Are your reasons for doing that reasonable? If something looks too far out for your comfort just adjust a bit and chill.",goodbodha,0,,,2025-10-15 22:19:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o7k4f0/i_bought_qqq_in_november_of_2023_it_has_doubles/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o7k4f0/i_bought_qqq_in_november_of_2023_it_has_doubles/njojvvr/

njoi0xa,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"It appears that a lot of people approach CCs and CSPs as solely a way to make income, as opposed to a way to increase the gains of their portfolio via income.

The difference is nuanced but makes all the difference.

What I see many do is chase premiums. They buy a stock primarily or exclusively because it pays a high ROI premium. When the stock drops they then fault the CC strategy because they see the ownership of the stock and the sale of the CC as one and the same. Instead, they should already plan to own the stock, then sell the CC on top of it. That difference in outlook helps them separate the two components.

When viewed as two related but separate components, it’s easier to view the two moving parts differently. You can only lose money on the CC if you select a price below your cost basis and the shares get called away.

njoczd8,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"I would have to disagree about covered calls not being low risk. 

Because most people associate “risk” in the stock market with losing money (not limiting potential gains), I’m going to assume the OP is asking if there’s a strategy with lower risk of losing money than selling CCs - therefore qualifying CCs as low risk because it carries a low chance of losing money. 

The only way to lose money when selling covered calls is by selecting a strike that’s lower than your cost basis, then having the shares called away at that lower price. That’s it.

The loss of unrealized value can come from the underlying stock but has nothing to do with the CC. That has everything to do with the stock selection (quality stock vs poor stock) and the time horizon (short periods are often volatile, while long periods trend up). The stock will go up or down regardless of whether a CC is sold on it or not.

To me, that’s the epitome of a “low risk” option strategy. 

To answer the OP’s question, selling covered calls and cash secured puts are the lowest-risk option plays that you can make. Once you start getting into defined risk plays like iron condors, and other spreads, you have to be correct about the directional movement of the stock. If you aren’t, you risk losing a multiple of the cash you make from the premium. Those are definitely higher risk. 

If you’re concerned about the risk of losing money with options plays, stick to covered calls and cash secured puts. If you’re concerned about capping your upside gains, stick to cash secured puts. But make sure that you’re only running these plays on stocks you actually want to own. Too many people select their stocks for CCs and CSPs based on what will give them the highest premium, then select stocks that they wouldn’t want if it weren’t for the option plays. That’s the fastest way to get trapped selling options. Stick to stocks you actually want to own for a long time, pick strikes in relation to your cost basis, then you’ll be just fine. 

If you’re unhappy with the results from selling these kinds of options, I assume it’s because you want more premium from them. You should consider selecting strikes with higher deltas, or considering stocks with higher volatility (but again, make sure they’re stocks you actually want to own).",davidsidesmusic,7,,,2025-10-15 21:44:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7bjkk/is_there_a_genuine_strategy_that_is_lower_risk/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7bjkk/is_there_a_genuine_strategy_that_is_lower_risk/njoczd8/

Right now the market is less than 2% from ATH, not that exciting 

The timing of this Chinese escalation is interesting though. Why didn't they stand tough back in April, when: 

- The US was fighting the entire world at once
- Europeans were pissed at both trade war and Trump's stance on Ukraine 
- USD, UST, U.S. Stocks were all under pressure
- The Trump admin hadn't passed any meaningful legislation yet
- Trump's policies were bogged down by local judges
- DeepSeek driving deep doubts into the U.S. AI boom

----------


Now the situation is quite different: 

- DeepSeek R2, originally announced in late April, is being delayed again and again. [Difficulties reported in late June](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/deepseek-r2-launch-stalled-ceo-balks-progress-information-reports-2025-06-26/) still hasn't been resolved yet
- US AI boom taking off to another level, along with massive new power generating capacities 
- Iran's air force annihilated by Israel, its nuclear facility destroyed by U.S., its 3000 ballistic missile stockpile exhausted after doing minimal damage 
- Arab countries and Turkey make peace with Israel, and stand firmly behind Trump 
- Trade deals with its Allies done
- United front in Ukraine against Russia
- OBBB passed and money for his agenda there 
- District courts and SCOTUS mostly ruling in his favor 
- USD stabilized, 10 yr UST is 0.6% lower than the peak in April

njoam8e,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is this a good proportion of investments for my portfolio? I plan to just stick to these and try to live off of dividends when I retire I’m 20 right now,"A lot of people in the comments are giving advice, but no one is giving real advice in my opinion. Here's my advice for you:

1. Does your job offer a retirement plan? If so, are you taking part in that retirement plan? The reason I am asking this is because a lot of people will use that as their growth portfolio which negates 95% of the comments below. This is a dividends sub, so having dividends ETFs makes sense.

2. If your job does not offer a retirement account, I would open a Roth IRA and contribute your growth positions into there. You have a max contribution of $7,000 per year until 50 years old when it turns into $8,000 per year. A good split would be VTI (75%) and VXUS (25%).

3. Your taxable brokerage account is what you should be using as your dividend portfolio in my opinion. This will allow you to draw on it early and potentially bridge the gap for paying bills or having an early retirement. SCHD is a fine ETF, JEPI is not my favorite because I do not like covered calls. I would recommend a split between the following: O, income reality (monthly payer), VYM (similar to SCHD but has a slightly lower yield. The % growth is much higher than SCHD), VYMI (international version of VYM), and MAIN (monthly payer that focused on providing capital for business start up).

I'm 45. AI will probably make my job obsolete in the next 5-10 years. 
I didn't rise above poverty until 2017. I make a modest income but it's not poverty anymore. I've only been saving and investing since then. 
I have ROTH IRA.
I also have VOO and SCHD (obviously it's been doing well since 2017). 
Main goal: don't be homeless when AI comes for my job.

I had a decent amount of extra money sitting in a safe Schwab managed account. When the market went down in the end of 2023 I got inspired and said fuck it, and put it all in on QQQ (I know QQQ has lots overlap with VOO but I wanted take a bigger swing). 

It's done well, it's doubled. But the AI bubble might burst sson and all the tech companies in QQQ crash. 

My instinct is to let it ride. I plan to not need it in the next 10 years.
I've thought that maybe I could sell the gains and put it in a safer investment, just play with the house's money.
Or sell ALL of it, maybe I'm overexposed to the S & P 500.

njo4r11,comment,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"The general consensus is that as you draw nearer to retirement you begin to move money out of more risky stocks and begin to look at funds that generate income. So, you keep your million in the market but it now for example sits in an ETF which will generate some income, or in Bonds are another option, pay higher returns  but their issue is they tend not to have the growth potential of index funds and can lower your capital value in a  bear market.  

My plan, if I make it that far, is to probably use bonds for income with a part of my investments, but only what i actually need to be spending, but keep some in dividend paying index trackers so a part of my pot hopefully continues to grow whilst bringing in albeit less income. 


It's more complex than that, but thats generally the idea. 


There are even companies which offer a fund which is based on the year you plan to retire who, as that time approaches, begin to move the funds access towards income, so you don't have to do anything.

Part of the reason to do this is advance of retirement is to lower the risk (if the bubble burst and the market suddenly moves down 40% then you're massively affected right now, but, of course, if you'd been selling off both of these over the last 5 years then you'd have made a lot less money so..)

The other reason is tax, to make sure you're not suddenly selling a million dollars worth of shares and losing however much to the tax man.

Given the figures involved it wouldn't be a bad idea to take professional advice, but make sure it's something you pay at the time, not as a % of your portfolio going forward!

Well done on holding for so long, I.got into NVIDIA at $20 a share and was happy to see a 100% gain, at which point I sold.. seems odd that one of my biggest regrets investment wise is a 100%+ profit, but there you go, but this is exactly why you are sitting on such a big sum right now, and I'm not, you just kept holding and ran your own race..

Wishing you a long, happy and hopefully financially stable retirement.",Dense_Debt_1250,1,,,2025-10-15 21:03:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njo4r11/

njnufjd,comment,options,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"1) Low risk is a function of size relative to total account value. Risk is never off the table no matter the strategy. Performance is really your underlying question. *Are there any strategies that outperform cover calls? Sure. In my opinion long calls and long puts out perform CC if you have directional edge with tight stop controls. 

2) iron condors/butterflies/spreads produce mathematical negative expectancy without serious active management. All of these blow up without directional edge. All Greeks are second order, Delta aka Direction is the king daddy of all. Also if you are not customizing your spreads you are selling and buying out of the box money losers. Brokers/MM set those prices to skew in their favor not ours.

3) Look up these channels on YouTube, some of their videos detail long strategies. Theta Profits, Options with Ravish, ZeroDayMark, SMB capital is best for short term trades. I’m not affiliated with any one of them. Don’t know them personally nor was I paid to share. I just found some other their content helpful.

That's a bit simplified but that's really what market cap calculation is.  If NVDA drops 10% in a week, people don't freak out. Heck it dropped 5% yesterday.

1o7ib6m,post,wallstreetbets,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,LINC will flash before my eyes,"“One day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it's worth watching” - Gerard Way. 

LINC is education for trade schools. Plumbers, electricians, mechanics; The bois who will be building our so called data centers. We’ve been hearing it from top CEOs, and LINC has been reacting, but not nearly enough. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories” - Jensen Huang. Even Elon is attempting industrial revolution part 2. Our ambitions are impossible to achieve right now with the lack of skilled labor…something LINC is rapidly gaining market share in solving. 

Now, onto my theory as it relates to LINC. One could, in theory, live as though unpreturbed by the world around them. The dissociative state is indeed not merely a theory, but a way of life for many. The concept of detaching one’s consciousness from the perceived world that perpetually exists in a quantum state is nothing new (nothing ever happens unless you perceive it. Don’t believe me? OK. It not like I’ll perceive you in disbelief). 

I however, choose the path of absurdism with $6k in **40 $22.5 10/21,** a limit order for 10 more, and looking to enter another 40 when my funds settle for a total of **$13.5k.**

Imo, ATGE, 10x the valuation of LINC, has every right to be at 5bn market cap. But LINC has no right to be worth 10x less. They struggled recently, but have since turned themselves around. Will wait another month then broker a meeting between LINC Ceo and Jensen. I have those connects, truuuuuuust (don't trust me).

Whatever the outcome, I can guarantee it won’t be my kids flashing before my eyes, it will be LINC.

TLDR: Jensoon Hoong, Eloon Moosk, Boozoos Joof like people to build things for them.

njnp1ca,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"Okay, so let’s say you own 100 shares of QQQI. You think the stock will go up, let’s assume it’s $55 per share, about a buck higher than reality. 

What I would do is, let’s say I think it’ll go to $60. I will buy a CC at $58 if I have a strong feeling or got a tip, or I’ll buy a CC at 56-57 bucks for a safer bet. It’ll reach my strike price faster and has a lower risk of reversing. 

At the same time, I would buy a put for maybe $54 or $52 to hedge the downside risk. That way, even if it goes down, I still have a put to make me money. 

This is a bare bones explanation of covering spreads. There are named strategies you can use, but covered calls (CCs) have long term downside exposure. That’s where the put comes in.

IXUA: iShares MSCI World ex-USA UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

EXUS: Xtrackers MSCI World ex USA UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

I noticed that iShares consistently outperform the Xtrackers by around 0.2%. What might be behind this? Is it that iShares track the index more precisely? Or perhaps because iShares are in the initial phase of rapid growth and this has some effect on performance?

I started buying the Xtrackers ETF in February this year when iShares were still very new, so there was no data to compare it with. Did I make a mistake by going with Xtrackers?",Teflon_490,5,0.86,3.0,2025-10-15 19:33:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o7hja0/ixua_msci_exus_outperforming_exus_xtrackers_msci/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o7hja0/ixua_msci_exus_outperforming_exus_xtrackers_msci/

1. A CEO not financially incentivized by the outcomes of the business is always a concern yes. It means he may not be fully invested emotionally in the company.

2. This comment also in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o76n5f/comment/njlik8a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o76n5f/comment/njlik8a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
\^ If this is true, then Rigetti may be a research project. One of the biggest problems Venture Capital has had in the last 2-3 decades is not being able to discern the difference between a research project, and a business. It funds them both. This is why unicorns with billion+ valuations go bankrupt: because they were never solid businesses to begin with, either the market didn't exist or the tech was so ambitious the engineering challenges were never overcome enough for the market to adopt. If the CEO of Rigetti truly believes revenues will not begin any time soon, then they should begin applying for research grants and possibly re-transfer their tech to a university, rather than persist as a company. This is a legitimate reason to unwind the business and return what capital can be returned to creditors; far better this, than to keep raising funding rounds of venture capital that is intended to start businesses, if this won't be a business for a decade.",cogit2,1,,,2025-10-15 19:32:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o76n5f/rigetti_ceo_does_not_own_any_shares_of_the/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o76n5f/rigetti_ceo_does_not_own_any_shares_of_the/njnma5w/

njnip1z,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Oct 15, 2025","not gonna lie I didn't even know about this one... 

but for the question, no I was mainly tackling the situation where you make $190k and have to decide between selling as a short trade or waiting for a long trade. The equivalence at 32% short tax rate vs 15% long tax rate is a 20% drop in the stock while waiting for it to become long term. N.I.I.T applies to both LT and ST so while it does make a difference in the percentage, it's a minor difference in this situation.

In your case, your trades are already LT if I'm reading correctly, meaning the weight is more about market volatility vs tax tradeoffs. You're only trying to avoid a 3.8% tax rate here on your take home, which to be honest is a really small number to worry about. Looking at the ratios on the decision,

    (take home after niit) = (take home avoiding niit) * (1 - market loss)
    
    (1-0.243) = (1-.205) (1 - market loss)
    
    market loss = 1 - .952 = 4.8% 


So you'd need the market to drop less than 4.8% within 3 years, to justify this approach. From there it'd be a probability analysis, on how likely that is, how much you weigh that possibility vs how much you weigh the probability of a market gain in next 3 years.",OverlordEtna,2,,,2025-10-15 19:14:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o744k9/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_oct_15_2025/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o744k9/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_oct_15_2025/njnip1z/

njnago9,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Oct 15, 2025","market leaders underporming the indices and shit stocks pumping is a classic topping/distribution pattern.

Before downvoting like you always do, please read a little more.

Gross and Net leverage are both near record highs. Gross leverage is just what it sounds like, gross leverage. Net leverage factors in positions of long and short.

When Vol is low and everything is nice and clean, funds employ a lot of gross leverage. They short shit stocks and long stocks they like which allows then to get additional gross leverage without too much net exposure. 

However, when volatility creeps up, or we start seeing massive liquidations, these funds need to reduce gross leverage. What they do is sell some of their leaders, while ALSO buying their shit stocks back to reduce gross leverage while keeping net leverage the same.

So all the highly shorted stocks outperforming and some of the leaders underperforming is pretty clear evidence we are seeing degrossing.

Factor in credit issues on both private and subprime, plus the RPP going to zero, the trade war heating up etc.... and you should understand why I am so bearish in the very short term.

I live in California, and I'm mostly taxed at 24.3% on LTCG (combined Federal & State), but when you go over 200k, then it jumps to 28.1% because of the NIIT.

I'm trying to unwind a bunch of risk in my portfolio, because I'm going to be retiring very soon. But, due to how the taxes play out, I'm trying to unwind over a 3 year period. Hopefully the bubble doesn't completely pop before I'm able to get out of the majority of my risk.

This tax year of 2025, I'm going to keep my MAGI barely below 150k, so that I can put 8k into my standard Roth for tax year 2025. If I hit 150k or more, I can't put anything into my standard Roth for tax year 2025. That would kinda suck. So, I'm trying to arbitrarily stay under than 150k total.

1o7f42d,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,$DNN + DoD Meeting (Oct 23) = 💰💰💰 The Easiest DD of Your Life.,"So we’ve all heard about the US government wanting to onshore uranium production. And we’ve all heard of UUUU. Thats not what I’m here to talk about. The best opportunity that many people are overlooking is Denison mines or DNN. Denison mines owns the wheeler river project. Which has the highest grade of uranium around. It contains uranium or that is 100 times higher grade than the global average.

Because the deposit is so high-grade and has favorable geology, Denison can use a low-cost, low-impact mining method called In-Situ Recovery. The combination of ultra-high quality ore and a low-cost extraction method gives it the potential to be one of the most profitable uranium mines on the planet.

Why this is important is because the Department of Defense is hosting a major conference on Thursday, Oct 23 and one of the key agenda items is the nuclear fuel cycle as a national security imperative.

The meeting's stated purpose is to discuss using the full financial power of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to strengthen critical supply chains. This means they are actively discussing how to provide government support (which can include direct funding, grants, and other incentives) to accelerate the development of essential projects. A project like Denison’s, a high grade and low cost mine, is exactly the type of project the US government is looking to support.

I predict the stock is going rip based on what they announce in the meeting.

1o7dswy,post,france,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,What is the minimum time for marriage date after submission of the documents,"I had a very unpleasant experience at the Mairie office in France. Initially I was told the processing time and giving us a marriage date is 10 days. So if we took our documents before Ocotber 15 we can have the marriage date on End of Ocotober. 

We went there on Ocotber 10, weeks gave our documents, the person who was accepting them was very unkind, she made us feel very stressed. She told me they can give us a date in 2 months. 
I asked to talk to the guy who told us 10 days, he told us he misexpained it or whatever. 
However, the woman gave us a date after 2 months and 10 days, which is super close to the Christmas break (so I will receice the document in January). 

My question is where can I learn about the minimum and maximum number of days they need to process and if I send an “Lettre Recommendez” will it help our case of changing the date at least at the beginning of December?

njmu0n3,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Circular Deals Amongst AI Companies Means an Even Bigger Disaster Waiting to Happen,"Bro this is literally my job idk what you’re on about. If boosting Productivity is the goal then RTO wouldn’t be a thing because all the research points in the other direction. They did it because they’re stuck on commercial office leases for the next 10+ years and needed to lay people off without paying severance. Thats a money decision. 

I think most people that actually worked in a large company can agree they’ve had an experience where a tool that really boosts productivity gets cut because they couldn’t justify the cost. Sure it brings you benefit but that gets torn apart if you don’t have hard numbers to back it which can be hard to do when it’s more of a supplementary product, tool, or service rather than a standalone.

If you’re a large company you have some minimal onboarding to multiple tools at once. Maybe you pay less because you only have 10 active users out of 1K in a department, but the idea is if a tool gets too expensive you are flexible enough to switch to another one. That’s called negotiating leverage. So they really don’t care if department ____ loves the tool, because if an account manager comes back and says the price for the next five years is going up 15% you can bet an email is getting sent out that employees will need to switch.",YungPersian,1,,,2025-10-15 17:13:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6hiev/circular_deals_amongst_ai_companies_means_an_even/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6hiev/circular_deals_amongst_ai_companies_means_an_even/njmu0n3/

1. low expectations,
2. better than feared vehicle deliveries during Q3 with their trimmed versions of Model 3 and Y, and
3. potentially an announcement for a new line-up in 2026,

I could image that the stock rips from here.

On the other hand, if they disappoint on the points I mentioned above, paired with the now gone federal EV tax credit, it might also be a catalyst for a significant leg down. 

In any case, I think this will def move the stock significantly from here (also since we are smack bang in the middle of their MA30).

I would normally just buy a bull spread into their earnings (https://s.opti-view.com/f64f6c91ea). 

However, since this time it might also be quite bad, I thought about also buying a bear spread to create an iron condor of sorts (https://s.opti-view.com/2fbdcdfc61).

However, the additional long IV and theta are essentially eliminating all upside potential. Any suggestions?

njmlmf0,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Circular Deals Amongst AI Companies Means an Even Bigger Disaster Waiting to Happen,"My issue is these companies are assigning upstream demand and value for their services based on newer tech that we’re still very much figuring out how to best commercialize. These partnerships and contracts are definitely first-mover strategic overbuilds to avoid capacity constraints and make aggressive assumptions on what the broader market is needing/willing to pay.

This part is going to sound like I’m beating a dead horse but the last time they did something like this was during the dot com boom for fiber networks, what ended up happening is half of the massive networks they built out sat empty. That meant bankruptcy for a lot of players and was a big part of the bubble at that time. Again at that time this was the new tech; hindsight is 20/20 but if a company realizes they can’t commercialize AI tooling as much as they thought they would then they will bow out. Companies like OpenAI and NVIDIA have certainly executed well on product; but their continued success is based on the market creating cash cows out of their tech. And by cash cow I mean to the tune of trillions of dollars based on how much value has been assigned to these companies.  A complimentary service that makes a product nicer to use isn’t worth trillions. There isn’t a product in the pipeline that’ll bring that type of value to the table yet.

History repeats itself. I can say given the pressures to drive revenue and EBITDA in the market cycle we’re currently in, the Fortune 50 company I work at would likely have absolutely no desire to spend whatever Oracle would want people to pay to recoup their investments. These data center commitments are really trying to pinpoint what they think the need would be in 5-10 years. So if that demand plateaus because companies realize where their point of diminishing return is then everything goes kaput and history repeats itself.",YungPersian,2,,,2025-10-15 16:31:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6hiev/circular_deals_amongst_ai_companies_means_an_even/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6hiev/circular_deals_amongst_ai_companies_means_an_even/njmlmf0/

I don't think Road Networks are a major concern. The money is made in high traffic areas with more developed networks and generally robotaxi services operate on limited routes or neighborhoods. I dont perceive this to be a long-term challenge given the pace of progress and the talent in these companies (in general, not specific to WeRide).

njmj2w6,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a genuine strategy that is lower risk than CC,"No mechanical options strategy beats buy&hold in terms of risk adjusted returns.

I should note that selling cash secured puts is equivalent to selling CCs btw.

If you want to reduce volatility, the most efficient thing is to buy a collar (sell call, use the credit to buy a protective put). But that's just equivalent to holding fewer shares and holding the rest in cash. So the only reason to do it is tax efficiency (you want to reduce exposure on an appreciated stock position without selling immediately, beware of constructive sale rules though).

You can also just buy protective puts. That will really cut into your returns long term due to the cost but will reduce risk and can be a winner short term when you believe IV is understated and/or a genuine a crash occurs. So if short term risk reduction is your primary goal, then simple protective puts is the play.",SaneLad,10,,,2025-10-15 16:18:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7bjkk/is_there_a_genuine_strategy_that_is_lower_risk/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7bjkk/is_there_a_genuine_strategy_that_is_lower_risk/njmj2w6/

njmea1c,comment,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Apple is a declining company because it is run by accountants, not engineers or designers. 

They have never released anything particularly innovative. They let other companies release good things, would release a better version of the product. Now they just improve things slightly each year - accountants ahead of design & innovation.

They shrugged off AI with their wait and see process and now things are developing so quickly that they cannot catch up. They also continue to refuse to invest significantly despite having massive cash reserves. 

They abused their dominance and the iOS closed ecosystem is being torn down by regulators.

Ive, the designer behind almost every iconic project left a company he dedicated his life to because Apple became too focused on operations, finance and risk aversion. 

Tim Cook did a good job, particularly around developing supply chains that made the company massively profitable. He should have stepped aside and let someone else take over. Imagine Ive as CEO and Cook moving to COO back in 2019. Creative direction, design and brand identity taking priority with Cook ensuring the cogs continue to run well (the experience that Ive lacks). 

If Ive is given free rein at open AI and they somehow reimagine the phone, it’s easy to believe that Apple will have its Nokia/Blackberry moment by the end of this decade.",caattta,2,,,2025-10-15 15:52:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/njmea1c/

njmcaeg,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Your forgot to mention $1.5 billion in zero-interest debt expiring 2026. They don't have the cash to repay and guess what? New debt is not zero-interest anymore and interest on $1.5 billion takes a significant stake on their earnings.

Also literally 99% of their customers leave before earning them anything - they have 500 enterprise customers (they call them ""Scalers+"") versus 500,000 poor Indian dudes running VMs (""Learners"" and ""Builders"") who leave before earning them a buck (their Net Dollar Retention Rate is < 100%). Those are the actual numbers from their release.

They have no moat against AWS or other cloud giants, historically they sold a VM / VPS called Droplet and didn't offer much else, they are only now starting to offer one or two managed services, as their customer's products grow they are forced to leave to more complete offerings like AWS.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a happy customer for over 10 years and entered at $28, but at $40 I don't think there is enough moat to compensate the risk. The time to buy was the dip to $25. Their last issuance to repay expiring debt was $800M at SOFR+1.75%, ~6.1% at time of issuing which gives $91.5M a year in interest. At their guidance back then of 1.95 EPS x 95.29M shares = $185.8M in earnings, minus $91.5M interest = $94.815M / 95.29M shares = EPS 0.995, so roughly the share price is the PE you pay. The sector PE is currently 34, last 10y it's 23, and last 20 years it's 18. At $40 you're paying a high price for maybe some short-term AI earnings (even that is not a guarantee as there's lot of competition) and dubious long term prospect.

njma764,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Looking for strategy advise,"Government shutdown, tariff situation, and uncertainty around macro data. The jobs report being especially worrying and the threat that the rich stop propping up consumer spending. 

It’s still uncertain just how much tariffs have affected prices. Recent reports showed us that companies absorbed a lot of the initial impact which was paired with a great earnings season. Rich people are still spending which has overshadowed extremely low consumer sentiment. If earnings were to falter, companies begin to offload more costs onto the consumer, or rich people stop spending, the market will begin to react more to macro data. 

I should’ve said this month and next because the reports will give us a lot more clarity on if tariffs will impact consumers in a significant way, thus impacting the stock market. If labor data also continues to disappoint then we’re in a situation where the Fed’s hands are tied.

It really could be another liberation day scenario where the data comes in and it’s very favorable to the market and it continues to rally.

It seems your post is targeted toward cryptocurrencies. 

Cryptocurrency has been characterized as a speculative bubble by many well-respected financial figures. It is

sure to perform sufficient research into the coin you are considering buying, prior to making a purchase. The 
future of crypto is uncertain, so please do not take advice from anyone suggesting that you are guaranteed to 
earn a profit. Always do your own research before making any financial decision.

I’m posting this to document a very suspicious liquidation event that happened to me and may have affected other KuCoin (and other exchange) Futures users.

Date / time: Friday, Oct 10th 2025 – 23:17 UTC  
Pair: XRPUSDM (KuCoin Futures)  
Context:  
I had a partial stop loss placed well above liquidation level. Out of nowhere, at 23:17, my stop was triggered and liquidated way below my set level — even though the KuCoin market never touched that price.  
Both the margin call and the liquidation alert arrived in the exact same minute, suggesting an instant, system-wide trigger.

After checking the data in detail, here’s what I found:

* The Index Price (used by KuCoin) suddenly dropped for less than a second.
* This drop matched a flash crash on Binance, which didn’t occur anywhere else.
* There’s strong on-chain evidence of anomalous fund movements from Binance-linked wallets during that minute.
* The pattern looks like intentional market manipulation, possibly involving spoofing, wash trading, stop-hunting, or manipulation of index feeds.

This single Binance spike seems to have cascaded into KuCoin’s Index Price, instantly liquidating open positions on multiple pairs.

I’m trying to connect with others who experienced similar behavior or have data/logs from that timeframe.  
If you had abnormal stop triggers or liquidations on 23:17 UTC on Oct 10 event, please comment and stary in touch.

Let's say I want to live off €30k a year funded by a dividend ETF with a 3 to 4% yield. With no capital gains tax, you would require around €750k to €1 million.

However, The Netherlands doesn’t tax realized capital gains. Somehow the government decided that it's a good idea to instead charge an annual wealth tax based on an assumed rate of return on your assets, regardless of whether you actually made that return. If you would sell after let's say a decade and our investment didn't make a return, you've still paid a nice some of taxes.

To be able to pay of these taxes each year in early retirement you wouldn't need the initial assumed amount but about €1.5 to 3 million if you don't want to touch the principal each year. If you do, your capital would grow much slower.

Am I missing something here or this a correct assumption of funding early retirement in The Netherlands? It seems taxes here make such an impact that it becomes way harder to retire early solely on dividends alone.

Thanks a lot in advance for any feedback or tips!",Efficient-Mood7896,163,0.86,158.0,2025-10-15 15:11:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o7alwr/early_retirement_in_the_netherlands_harder_due_to/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o7alwr/early_retirement_in_the_netherlands_harder_due_to/

Yes, the drone services & maintenance market is already large and growing (multiple market studies put global drone servicing/repair and services in the tens of billions and forecast high CAGR). Defense primes have structured Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) programs and digital spare parts management. Also, the US military is aiming to increase drone manufacturing to 10,000 drones per month by 2026, so this sector will parabolically grow. Lastly, I want to emphasize that Stratasys isn’t just a drone maintenance play, as I wrote above, its technology has broader aerospace and defense applications including flight-qualified parts, tooling, prototyping and digital warehousing.

J’aimerais relancer la discussion sur les règles liées au karma nécessaire pour poster sur r/france. J’aimerais tout d’abord savoir comment le seuil de 50 a été défini et surtout j’aimerais le remettre en question.

Ce seuil avait du sens au départ, lorsque les utilisateurs de reddit suivaient encore généralement la consigne de downvote uniquement le contenu qui ne devrait pas trouver sa place sur le site. Aujourd’hui, les gens l’utilisent comme bouton “je ne suis pas d’accord”. 

Le problème avec ce comportement est que la majorité du sub étant affilié à LFI (cf sondage post élections), les avis dissidents commencent à être downvotés pratiquement systématiquement et cela crée ensuite une chambre d’écho sur le fil d’actualité du sub.

Je sais que ce sub n’est pas une démocratie, cependant une des règles fondamentales de celui-ci est de garantir la pluralité d’opinions. 
Or, celle-ci est mise en péril et personne ne gagne à ne pouvoir débattre avec des gens avec lesquels ils ne sont pas d’accord.

J’aimerais simplement lancer l’idée de modifier la règle des 50 upvotes pour par exemple rendre l’adhésion permanente, une fois que vous avez obtenus x upvotes, vous ne devez plus rester au dessus des 50 pour garantir votre participation, un simple respect des règles du sub devrait suffire. Voilà, c’est un exemple et je suis certain que les modos pourraient être plus créatifs que moi pour garantir la pluralité des avis.

njlxxhc,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,What’s if there are no stock crash anytime soon,I just keep dollar cost averaging into VT and a little bitcoin and call it a day. It's really not that complicated. We have survived multiple crashes over decades. I don't see why it matters when a crash comes this week or in 5 years. Just park some cash here and there if you really want to prepare for a buying opportunity. Selling would just be really stupid.

1o7954w,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Ahoy Mateys,

Last week I introduced you guys to the [P A T H](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which was up 30% until the Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on Friday. I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!

But now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!

I noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. 

Below, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.

End of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.

https://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53

Trendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.

Now lets look at fUnDamENtalS

**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything. THINK MARK, THINK. 

**They’re selling SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH**

Now, as if just being a data center isn’t enough to send a stock flying in this market… \**cough cough\**… APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD… \**cough cough*\* DOCN has something that few emerging AI/data/cloud companies bring to the table…**EARNINGS. This company actually makes money. They have a 31 p/e and reported an adjusted EPS of $.92 on September 4, 2025.** 

**DOCN IS ALSO A DIRECT VENDOR OF AMD CLOUD COMPUTING GPUS.** 

**The numbers:** Go ahead, take a look. Find me another data/AI company with a $3b market cap boasting numbers like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jlywjt63n9vf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed35a8ce47fd7ee30ddb33f5c79e97f87ed2a45

These guys are printing money for their size. **They BIGLY beat earnings expectations eight times in a row. Last earnings they pumped 30%.** For comparison, APLD has a market cap 3x larger with only \~60m in quarterly revenue. (thats like one third of the quarterly revenue DOCN makes.) Jensen Huangs speech last week emphasized the importance of data centers. And that’s not where the NVDA connection stops…

**New Partnerships:** ever heard of NVDA? Ever heard of AMD? Ever heard of openAI? Well… DOCN has deals with **ALL THREE**. The openAI deal is brand new as of October 2025. AS IF this company isn’t a powerhouse on its own… they stand to be a DIRECT BENEFICIARY to the AMD/openAI deal… You know, the one that caused AMD to pump almost 50% last week???

 Why? I’ll repeat it again you dense motherfucker. **DOCN IS A DIRECT VENDOR FOR AMD GPUS.** **NAMELY, THE MI300X CHIP.** openAI is driving the implementation of AMD’s chips to supplement the heavy chip demand. 

As i was preparing this, an additional AMD deal was announced with Oracle for deployment of 50,000 AMD cloud GPUs… data/cloud/ai is the place to be in this market. 

***Now of course this is WSB and who cares about fundamentals when the market runs on crushing those “not long” and exploiting gamma ramps, and this is where things start to get really spicy…***

**IV / TA** 

Let me be clear. This is a 31x p/e company with excellent cash flow. The thesis of this play is NOT a S I play, but a realization of value… That said, bears have painted themselves into a corner. DOCN went public in 2021 and pumped to an ATH of $133 within months… then, stock suffered a large drawdown in the 2021/2022 bear market but stabilized around 30 to 40, where it’s been sideways for three years despite growing their revenue and EPS. 

Per fintel, the stock has 15.57% S I… That’s not all… check out the insane gamma ramp for the November option expiration. 

https://preview.redd.it/aa979si9n9vf1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=35413ba0b91d84cc4994fb261e6c85214cef0e75

This can gamma ramp in a hurry with a breakout over $40-45, and IV is still very very low, sitting around 80% across most contracts. 

And because there’s no weekly options, market makers cannot easily hedge upwards momentum, so there’s absolutely nothing to stand in the way of this gamma ramp a month out if things pick up speed. Monthly options carry much greater gamma risk for market makers. You want in on this before it gets stacked with weeklies!

**Analysts upgrades:** turns out, I'm not the only idiot who has found this company… 

* Canaccord raised their price target from 49 to 55 10/10/2025
* UBS raised price target to 40 from 32
* Market Edge rates it as “Long” (their maximum rating)
* LSEG rates this stock as “out-perform” 

**Position:** Currently holding these calls post dating earnings.

40 x Jan '26 $55c

30x December '25 $55c

55x November $50c

https://preview.redd.it/jrbuvp1pc9vf1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41b4bb0a338a482e04bf764f2a5631775eaaad9

TLDR; ***DOCN is*** ***SELLING SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH***, they’re a cloud/data center company that makes a lot of fucking money. They have a 30x p/e, a $3.6b market cap, established partnerships with AMD, NVDA, and a brand new October 2025 deal with OPENAI. They also stand to be a direct beneficiary of the AMD/openAI, and AMD/ORCL deal. Other data centers such as APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD have pumped to the moon, while DOCN has been sleeping despite the fact that it has incredibly strong numbers. The stock is breaking out of a 3 year consolidation. Previous ATH was 133.

1o793je,post,stocks,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,ESPP vs 401k,"Started an 18-month rotational program fresh out of undergrad, salary is $79k.

Currently maxing both my Roth 401k and Roth IRA since my income isn’t too high. I’m living with my parents in the suburbs where I work, so I’m avoiding rent until the program ends. Rent would be around $1,800/month, so I’m redirecting that money into my 401k instead. There’s about a 50/50 chance of relocation afterward, so I’d rather keep saving than risk breaking a lease.

Now I’m considering reducing my 401k contributions and putting that difference into my company’s ESPP. The plan looks solid, 15% discount on the last trading day of the month, with monthly purchases and a one-year holding requirement. Contribution cap is 10% of salary. The company’s stock is strong and company is a major household name.

Thinking about laddering the ESPP shares and potentially using that money as a down payment for a house in ~5–7 years. We also receive a decent RSU grant once the program ends (around $15–20k) with a 1 year vesting period.

1o78k68,post,stocks,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Great Returns On Investment","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion.

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap & Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to drone endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered drone with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market.

[Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk)

[Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) 

Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale.

[Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) 

As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET.  

**AI in print process optimization**

Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware.

**TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:**

* Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified.
* Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware.
* Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA).
* Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally      (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production.
* Drones - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing
* AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat

1o78a2v,post,france,SU.PA,Schneider Electric SE,Le jour où je quitterai reddit,"2028.

Le réveil sonne, 6h30, comme d'habitude je me lève et mon premier réflexe est de prendre mon téléphone pour aller aux chiottes. 
J'ai quelques notifications sur reddit, seul réseau social que j'utilise. La veille j'ai commenté sur un post populaire, une longue discussion s'en est suivi entre plusieurs internautes. 

Mais ça fait déjà plusieurs mois que cette obsession me trotte dans la tête, avec la merdification d'internet, des agents IA partout sur les réseaux sociaux, on ne sait plus si les vidéos qu'on regarde sont authentiques, pareil pour les photos, et les conversations avec des inconnus sur internet. 

Cette conversation sous mon commentaire m'intrigue, les internautes sont étonnamment pertinents, ils s'enfoncent très profondément dans le sujet, et leurs connaissances laissent à penser qu'ils sont de véritables experts dans le domaine en question. Des agents IA ? Probablement.

Il y a quelques mois, un scandale a secoué la silicon valley, notamment le monde des réseaux sociaux. Des millions d'agents IA participeraient sous de fausses identités ou pseudonymes sur les réseaux sociaux, comme Instagram, facebook, tiktok, reddit et d'autres, dans le but de gonfler les stats et nourrir l'algorithme. Car depuis l'arrivée de l'IA, les réseaux sociaux sont en berne, les utilisateurs les quittent en masse. 

Je me demande alors, à quoi bon avoir des conversations avec des inconnus sur internet, si je ne peux être sûr qu'il s'agit d'autres humains ? Si je veux parler à un chatbot-quisaittout, je vais sur chatgpt. L'expérience de forum à l'ancienne d'internet, la discussion authentique avec un autre être humain anonyme, est morte. Je vais quand même pas aller sur le dark et pour ça non ? 

Bon, cette fois c'est décidé, je quitte reddit, comme j'avais su le faire avec Facebook bien des années plus tôt. Dommage, j'aimais bien l'esprit.

njlpj2n,comment,wallstreetbets,AIR.PA,Airbus SE,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","Companies using AM can and have mitigated that by using phased approach by proving the process on non-safety-critical and sustainment items, then scaling to flight-support and finally to safety-critical structures after part-level testing, process control, and formal approvals. So yes, there’s a runway before broad in-airframe use, but it’s a predictable, engineering-driven runway rather than a blocker to adoption. 

There is also a recent albeit a bit light white paper that shows how AM is being adopted across the whole aerospace sector, adoption is ever increasing, and it details how Stratasys printers are cutting lead times by over 90% and costs by 50% for aerospace/defense parts and tooling, with direct adoption by the U.S. Navy and other organizations/program for mission-critical readiness (link below).

njlntul,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Ride or dump OKLO,"Congrats on the gains! I am in a similar position with a speculative ""play account"" and a $35 cost basis on OKLO.  This is clearly more of a momentum driven trade and not a fundamentally driven trade, so I have chosen to continue to hold these shares while the AI bubble and market cycle winds are blowing in the right direction. 

I am out of carried short term losses but I am coming up on a year this month on the first lot of shares and will be selling a small amount to cover my initial investment at a reduced tax rate. I am regularly calculating my break-even drop between long term and short term gains tax rate to figure out where to pull the ripcord in a down market. To answer your original question, I would come up with an exit strategy to get my initial investment out and then try to ride the wave and essentially time the market. This is your play account and there's no shame in breaking even on a longshot.

Longer term I really believe in OKLO's mission and aspirations but I don't know if the valuation makes sense and I am not qualified to assess the competitive landscape or regulatory hurdles they face. It is clearly riding the coattails of the AI bubble so behave accordingly. I absolutely think it continues to trend much higher from here, but calling a top is impossible. The valuation already doesn't make sense, so why can't it continue to not make sense?",Turd_Kabob,1,,,2025-10-15 13:03:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5xdy1/ride_or_dump_oklo/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5xdy1/ride_or_dump_oklo/njlntul/

​

If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or other ""advice for my personal situation"" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:

* How old are you? What country do you live in?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?
* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. .

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research.

njln987,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Weird markets: what's going on?,"I heard one explanation from a famous economist recently.

He said the following.

Partly this is because there is a lot of excess liquidity in markets, and investors want to put their money somewhere. However, there are no better options then developed world stocks or (government or high-quality corps) bonds. Same for gold and BTC. Maybe these instruments are high-risk, but staying in cash can be even worse.

TL;DR; current market instruments are rising because alternatives for the investors are even worse.

Hopefully, I managed to explain his take.

Also, he said that current situation is unprecedented, so we don't know what to expect. Usually, countries default on their debt obligations at some point.

But now is different.

Countries had learned from previous defaults. We see many government debts which are very high (USA, Japan etc). However, market participants are kinda fine with it, and do not expect a default (yet). Central bank borrowing rate is growing, which means investors are concerned a bit, but still far from a full blown panic. Thing is, when they will panic, it will happen quickly. Thing which investors cannot imagine now, like US defaulting on treasuries, will happen in a matter of days or hours.",Vladekk,51,,,2025-10-15 12:58:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o77d2o/weird_markets_whats_going_on/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o77d2o/weird_markets_whats_going_on/njln987/

njlm4fp,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Rigetti CEO does not own any shares of the company... huge red flag?,"What I meant to say is that this no-news. You already knew since months ago that he had no conviction, and everybody knew he would sell these shares. I doubt this has any effect on the stock.

Anyway, while I agree that RGTI is overvalued, I will give my two cents about why yours is a very bad idea. Think a bit more about the following scenario.

- You short a stock priced at $100 and worth $0. You buy long term puts for $20-30, or wherever the premiums are the most convenient
- Price rises to $150: fine — you say — I am a value investor
- Management dilutes, they have two ways to do it: they can make an acquisition paying with shares, or they can just raise capital issuing shares
   - They dilute over time by 30%, raising $30/share: now those shares are worth at least $30, that's book value, and your puts are dead
   - They dilute over some acquisitions by 30%, buying companies with real revenues and sane multiples: once again, your puts are dead
- Okay — you say — then I am getting some more margin of safety and using puts with much higher strike, let's say $60-70 strikes. The premiums for those are crazy, because of the volatility of these stocks, you are not going to make a killing, and you have to take very significant risk in order to make decent profits.

If I can offer an idea, what I have been doing lately is a pair trade on IONQ and CCCX. Long CCCX stock and sold short IONQ stock. At the moment CCCX is the least pumped quantum stock, and the one more likely to run higher imo. At the same time, I doubt IONQ can blow up without the rest of the quantum following thorugh.

Careful that the risk is that the CCCX SPAC for Infleqtion may fail, and that would kill the pair trade.",gamblingPharmaStocks,33,,,2025-10-15 12:48:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o76n5f/rigetti_ceo_does_not_own_any_shares_of_the/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o76n5f/rigetti_ceo_does_not_own_any_shares_of_the/njlm4fp/

1o77d2o,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Weird markets: what's going on?,"Since the correction in April neatly all equities are moving almost straight up. No matter what sector, no matter which investment strategy. All straight up. Only the volatility seems to be increased somewhat.

Even portfolio hedges which are supposed to have a low correlation with the market are moving perfectly in sync. We are even seeing new ATH's all the time for both the market and the precious metal complex, which is unseen since the 70's.

Same goes for factors: market, size, value, quality (i.e. proxy for the academic profitability & conservative investment factors) and momentum... All straight up.

Geographically: US, Europe, Developped Asia Pacific, EM,... All straight up.

Real estate (REIT's). Straight up.

In this market it seems impossible to loose money. Up low double digits YTD over all my portfolio's: growth, dividend, RE and precious metal complex.

If everything moves in sync, except for the economy (both US and EU in recession, China RE crisis,...). Is it just me or does something feel out of place here?

I've never been so stressed seeing double digit portfolio growth over less than 2 quarters, especially since in April I was still under water.

njljwbq,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"I saved €15,000 and not sure what to do with it. I need some investment advice","Index funds aren't by definition more conservative than stocks depending on the composition of said fund. They do bring higher risk adjusted returns since you're grabbing a larger portion of the market.

Really it depends on your financial situation, how long you can set aside the money, risk taking profile, what you are saving for.

One could consider contacting a qualified financial advisor for this matter.
If you don't desire to do so as a general rule of thumb

Risk levels (from high to low)
Derivatives
Stocks 
Real estate
Bonds
Savings account

The higher the risk the higher the possible rewards. Without sufficient knowledge however I would advise against using derivatives.
Crypto bit of a gray area, some say 5% crypto is the equivalent of investing in high risk tech stocks. So it's not impossible to invest in bitcoin I suppose, wouldn't do more than 5%.

If you're in it for the long run (10+) years and are willing to be a bit aggressive. Keeping most of it in index funds would be a good option. A spread of maybe 30-35% in something like the Stoxx 600 and the rest in an All World etf is not a terrible option.

Real Estate a possibility if you want a bit less risk. With 15.000 you're not buying anything yourself but there do exist funds for real estate you can partake in.

If you're looking at a 2 year time frame for example and are planning on using the money after two years (or are simply very risk averse).
Two year bonds or a 'locked' saving account for 2 years against higher interest is also a possibility.

One thing of note is that, depending on the country you're in, if your country of residence has strong social safety nets you can afford to be a bit more aggressive with your investments then if your country doesn't.",Mranonimo21,2,,,2025-10-15 12:29:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o77177/i_saved_15000_and_not_sure_what_to_do_with_it_i/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o77177/i_saved_15000_and_not_sure_what_to_do_with_it_i/njljwbq/

I’ve managed to save around €15,000 over the past few years, but now I’m stuck on what to do next. I don’t want to just leave the money sitting in my account losing value, but I also don’t want to risk it without knowing what I’m doing.

  
A bit of context:

No debt

Stable income (able to save a few hundred euros each month)

No investing experience so far

Don’t need the money anytime soon (thinking more long-term, like 5–10 years)

I’m wondering:

Does it make sense to start investing in stocks or ETFs (through platforms like Trade Republic, Revolut, Degiro, etc.)?

Should I look into something more conservative like bonds or index funds?

Or maybe explore alternatives such as real estate, crypto, or even a small business?

The European Union will propose launching joint drone and air defense projects in the coming months as part of an ambitious five-year plan to rearm the continent and constrain Russia, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News.

By the end of 2027, the plan wants the EU doing 40% of its defense procurement jointly, more than double the current rate.

What do you do?,"7% sounds amazing on paper, but I’d only use that for short-term goals or an emergency fund. It’s a guaranteed return and zero risk, which is great for peace of mind but it’s not going to make you wealthy.

The stock market’s obviously up and down, but over 10+ years it’s averaged around 8–10% a year (though past performance isn’t a promise for the future). The real magic is in compounding plus with dividends, you’ll probably beat a fixed 7% long term, especially once you factor in inflation.

But you could say the same about any of these companies. If apple stops innovating they’ll get left behind same with the others. 

Netflix is extremely sticky and the cheapest plan is 8 dollars month. That’s cheaper than a McDonald’s meal now. 

Netflix also has a top tier management team with Ted imo being one of the best ceos out there. 

I’m gonna be biased because I own Netflix but imo Netflix is one of the strongest companies out there. 

They’re subscription based too so their revenue isn’t going to bounce around like these other cyclical companies like Apple or NVIDIA which are hardware companies.

NVDA 53598%, TSLA 14619%, AVGO 10246% and AMD 6059%

TSLA and AMD were not profitable and NVDA had half a billion in profits.

njl80mo,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Hidden gems that haven’t run up yet,"If you mean ones that will rip this week or this month, who knows.

But if someone has multi-year patience, there’s some very tempting prospects.

Solar energy is free electricity from the sky.  It’s the cheapest, the safest, the cleanest, and the quickest electricity form.

The fact this anti-science and anti-reality regime has programmed people from all sides to think the opposite is a scenario than can’t continue forever.  

Especially not in an environment where communities that currently consume 1 GW of electricity are anticipating adding data centers that supposedly need 17 GW.  You don’t go from 1 to 18 without unbelievable amounts of generation.  Solar is cheap, safe, quick.  It’s not 17 GW, but whatever capacity it does add is practically free.

Profitable companies with best of breed products and solutions like **Enphase and Stem** are down 90%.  I don’t know if reality kick in during 2025 or 2026 or 2027.  I just know that when people remember that free and clean electricity is good, these will be multi bag wins.

**BROS** is a rapidly growing regional to national chain.  It’s well run, with sustainable growth, and healthy margins.  Their big name competitor has burnt their reputation, demoralized employees, been gone deaf to customers, and is currently shrinking and chopping and firing the rank and file even as they shatter all sense in executive compensation.  In contrast, BROS has happy customers and rising esteem in HundredX tracking.

Their most recent earnings was a monster beat, sending the stock up to near $90.  On no other actual news, it has declined almost every day since.  Some of that is being lumped into the QSR restaurant category, which isn’t right.  Some is every bungled step by SBUX being unfairly projected on BROS.  Some is overshot fear of coffee commodity costs.  Some is capital being yanked from anything physical and tangible into quantum and AI fairy dust futures.  

If the upcoming earnings builds on the last one, BROS here in the $40s could be brewing up a piping hot rebound.  If not, the traditionally strong Q4 is up next.  It’s fairly de-risked down here.

Base chemical component makers tend to be cyclical, and they’re way down deep in the cycle now, where they’ve been for an inexplicably long time.  I’m not that qualified to even explain exactly why.  I can’t fully explain why they’ve dropped so much, for so long.  You’ve got **DD, TRINSEO, DUPONT** type names that have been crushed.  TRINSEO is down to BK-worry levels, now $1-2 down from peaks in the $60’s.

Supposedly the expected turn in 2025 is now even in doubt for 2026. 

But the world does use and need these primary chemicals.  When the turn happens, for the ones that survive  gains could be *more* than 10x.

Personally, I can live with having a large position in things that a dead money for multiple years if there’s a prospect of a 10x later.

**Fear/vid/volatility instruments** are also beaten down.  They decay, so they’re typically always setting new all time lows.  But they usually spike on panic events, things the tend to happen at least once a year.  They spiked in April for instance, and two times during 2024.  

If you’re ready and able to sell a spike, that can be a double digit or even triple-digit gain.

**None of these are poised to surge any time soon.**  They’re mostly hated in the current market.  But that’s why they’re so cheap.  And that cheapness is why they could be multi-bag winners someday.",AntoniaFauci,1,,,2025-10-15 10:31:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6rkjc/hidden_gems_that_havent_run_up_yet/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6rkjc/hidden_gems_that_havent_run_up_yet/njl80mo/

Even better that you got these returns far earlier than you could’ve expected based on some of the expiries. These are crazy results but you’re 100% in calls and there’s a lot of uncertainty going into this month. You should hedge a bit with some puts with high beta or calls on stocks with beta around 0.5.

Not sure if others do this, but I try to keep the ratio of bullish and bearish plays at how I feel about the short/medium term performance of the market overall.

1o75ac8,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,CIFR: bitcoin miner turned HPC/AI data center!,"CIFR (21$/s). Bitcoiner miner turned HPC data center provider with 3.2GW pipeline. 
 
In July McKinsey technological trends reported that electricity demand will go from 25GW to 80GW by 2030 due to AI data centers. Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.

By August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. 

CIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it. Completely derisked and sitting on 1.3B of capital with 0% interest. 

Growth & Upcoming Catalyst 
The next deal is expected to be made by EOY per the CEO for 300MW site. This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. 

Once every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)

Currently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner. Rerating is on the horizon after the 300MW deal which could be soon. 

If you want daily chatter and deep-dive understanding I would recommend following Mike Alfred & Eric Jackson on X. ",Dyce10x,177,0.88,43.0,2025-10-15 10:19:08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o75ac8,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o75ac8/cifr_bitcoin_miner_turned_hpcai_data_center/

njl40v0,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How do we hedge against the AI bubble pop? (Serious discussion only),"You won't really know until it ends, what if this goes on for years? Or maybe next month? So at any rate if we look at previous cycles where you have had rotation, the money goes somewhere. In 2001 you wanted to load up on commodities, housing, rate sensitive sectors, small caps began to work early

This time, I don't think it's gold, it's already on a massive run. It could be small caps again, they are just beginning to work. It could be real estate, rates down, builders up. If the AI bubble pops it is likely to happen with unemployment going up and a weakening economy. The interesting parallel is things have been building for a while in the late 90s and then the top March 2000 followed by 9/11 followed by people just not believing the tech stories anymore and wanting to see real earnings. That last part is key but with a twist. We know companies today are far more profitable, but it's a lot of investment spending. How much is AI really making your average company right now? Now if profitability comes on rather soon and everything goes as the stories expect. The bubble may not burst but even a PE contraction could be pretty brutal long story short I don't think you can really plan for what happens, you just have to be on the lookout for what is beginning to work if tech starts going down",fairlyaveragetrader,1,,,2025-10-15 09:49:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6q85l/how_do_we_hedge_against_the_ai_bubble_pop_serious/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6q85l/how_do_we_hedge_against_the_ai_bubble_pop_serious/njl40v0/

Also Tim Cook is def one of the higher ceos in the mag 7. Even though people talk shit about him. Zoom out and he’s done a fantastic job at Apple. People need to put respect on his name imo. 

It’s definitely growing the slowest but who knows. Apple could pull another trick out of their sleeve and start growing. 

Remember when everyone said it’s over for Netflix and then Netflix said okay live events and advertising and that shut all the Netflix bears up really quick.

If you wanted to say that Apple is weaker due to being a hardware company I think that’s a fair point. But so is NVIDIA. That leaves them both to cyclical industries. Imo NVIDIA needs to figure out a way to create a services business or else imo they’re the weakest even though Jensen is a top tier ceo.

1o735sm,post,investing,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,"Long-Term Portfolio Advice: Choosing Between Index Funds (Developed, EM, Bonds) - Which Allocation is Best?","
Hey everyone,

I'm building a long-term investment portfolio (10+ years horizon) and have narrowed my choices down to five funds. I'm aiming for a solid balance of growth and risk management using index trackers.
The Available Funds
Here are the five funds available and their key characteristics based on the latest available data (as of 30/09/2025):

1. iShares Developed World Index USD, Developed Market Equities 
2. Vanguard ESG Dev. World All Cap Equity Index USD, Developed Market 
3. iShares Emerging Markets Index USD, Emerging Market Equities 
4. Vanguard Global Bond Index USD, Global Fixed Interest 
5. L&G Diversified USD, Flexible/Multi-Asset 

I initially ruled out the L&G Diversified fund for its high management charge (0.18%) and the Vanguard ESG fund because the non-ESG iShares alternative offered better performance/volatility and a lower fee (0.04% vs. 0.06%) over the 5-year period.
This leaves me with a core of iShares Developed World Index (low-cost growth), iShares Emerging Markets Index (strategic growth), and Vanguard Global Bond Index (stability).


 My Proposal: 70% Equity / 30% Bonds

1. iShares Developed World Index USD 50%, Core exposure to the highest-performing, lowest-cost equity index fund available. 
2. iShares Emerging Markets Index USD, 20%, Adds strategic diversification and exposure to volatile, but high-growth emerging economies.
3. Vanguard Global Bond Index USD, 30%, A significant allocation to the lowest-volatility asset for capital preservation and risk reduction.

Any advice on this indexing strategy would be greatly appreciated!

njkmadp,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is Cooking Oil trade the new Rare Metal trade? (ADM),"


Executive summary (short)





The claim that the U.S. can “just make our own cooking oil” is technically true (the U.S. already crushes soy and produces vegetable oil) but economically and politically complex. Producing more vegetable oil at scale requires feedstock (soy/canola/palm alternatives), processing capacity, time and investment — and it competes with other uses (animal feed, biofuels).  
ADM does have the structural advantage in U.S. crush and processing networks vs many rivals, so it is a logical “domestic supplier” candidate if policy pushes U.S.-first sourcing. But that advantage is necessary, not sufficient for a sustained re-rating — pricing, margins, and feedstock flows matter.  
Used cooking oil (UCO) is not a substitute for food-grade vegetable oil for households/restaurants — UCO’s primary commercial use is in biofuels and it’s a constrained, waste-stream feedstock. Overplaying UCO as a source for “food oil” or as a large, scalable substitute is mistaken.  









1) Technical & supply-chain reality





What “making our own cooking oil” actually means



It means increasing domestic crush of oilseeds (soybean, canola, sunflower) and refining them into food-grade vegetable oil. The U.S. already does this at scale; the top processors (ADM, Bunge, Cargill, AGP) crush the bulk of domestic soybeans and export meal + oil. Capacity is concentrated and dominated by a few players.  
Building new large crush/refining capacity takes years (permitting, site selection, construction, commissioning). Shorter-term responses mean shifting existing capacity usage, importing different oilseeds, or redirecting domestic crops — all of which have limits and costs.  




Feedstock constraint (the real choke point)



Vegetable oil comes from oilseeds. If China reduces purchases of U.S. soy, that can increase domestic availability of soybeans, but not automatically: farmers may reallocate, and existing export contracts / logistics are not instantly reversible. Also, Brazil/Argentina can and will increase exports to China, taking demand off U.S. soy (already happening).  




Used cooking oil (UCO) myth



UCO is valuable but limited. It’s primarily used in biodiesel/renewable diesel and prized because of a low carbon intensity score under clean-fuel rules. UCO cannot substitute for food-grade vegetable oil supply at scale without major quality and regulatory issues. Therefore, arguments that “we’ll use UCO to replace imported cooking oil” are category errors — different use-cases and markets.  









2) Timeframe & economics — why markets panic but the real world is slower





Immediate market reaction to a political post is sentiment & positioning: headline risk spikes, ETFs and names closely associated with the theme gap-trade. But re-rating a large industrial like ADM requires durable margin improvement, not a 48-hour tweet.
Capex & margin dynamics: processors make money from the crush spread (value of soybean oil + meal minus cost of soybeans + processing cost). Tariffs and policy can help by privileging domestic suppliers, but if soy prices rise (or biofuel demand is unstable) margins can compress. Short-term rallies often fade if commodity fundamentals don’t change.  









3) Comparison: ADM vs. Bunge — where the advantage really lies





Scale & domestic footprint: ADM is generally viewed as the largest processor with extensive U.S. crush/refining footprint; the top 3–4 firms (ADM among them) handle ~75% of crush volume, which gives ADM greater ability to serve any “Buy American” push.",petegameco_core,3,,,2025-10-15 06:57:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t9dk/is_cooking_oil_trade_the_new_rare_metal_trade_adm/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t9dk/is_cooking_oil_trade_the_new_rare_metal_trade_adm/njkmadp/

>Selling a put requires you to have the cash equivalent of the cost of 100 shares if assigned (150 \* 100 shares) this buying power is in lock up/not tradable for the duration on the short position.

This is a Cash Secured Put (CSP) which can be done in a standard margin account. A CSP will do what you say above.

There is a different option permission brokers usually call ""Naked Put"". A naked put can be cash secured if you wish, but the broker will no longer lock out that cash and prevent you from using it. They will instead take the value of your account and calculate a ""buying power"" number from it which also includes the value of any marginable securities such as stocks and ETF's. This ""buying power"" number is then reduced each time you sell a put, but not by the full put notional value, only a fraction of it. 

Note you are not borrowing this amount on margin, and you do not need Portfolio Margin account for this.

njkjdna,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Using a synthetic covered call vs. PMCC,">Using a synthetic covered call

This doesnt mean what you think it means and what you have is not a ""synthetic covered call"".

Having a longer dated call and then selling a shorter dated call is a diagonal call spread or PMCC(although this is typically with LEAPS specifically). Having other options positions doesnt change it, so the short put doesnt matter here.

>Does this make any sense? I understand there may be additional leverage and risk, but is this sound and manageable on smaller bets?

This doesnt make your bets smaller, it creates a much higher risk exposure compared to just debit paid for the call(the fact that you are stuck on the premium paid for the call being smaller means you really should pause and learn about this strategy a bit more before doing anything). 

Theta decay for a 2028 put LEAPS is not there essentially, so your short put doesnt decay until the last few months. This means your exposure to the downside persists until that time with the put keeping vast majority of its value.

The other issue you create with a synthetic is that your call strike becomes the highest you can sell your covered calls on (by making it a calendar spread) without needing more buying power as a reserve. Example with a $150 strike AMD LEAPS can easily sell calls at $150 or higher. But say with a $210 call LEAPS  if you sell the $200 because AMD drops for a bit to the $190's your broker will now require you to have more buying power to support the potential $10 loss between $210 LEAPS and the $200 short call. So this limits your ""optionality"" for the short call.",QuarkOfTheMatter,3,,,2025-10-15 06:32:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o6xuml/using_a_synthetic_covered_call_vs_pmcc/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o6xuml/using_a_synthetic_covered_call_vs_pmcc/njkjdna/

What’s insane is that hardly anyone is seeing actual value from this godlike amount of cash movement. For dotcom it was new tech and web development that led to innovation on scale and 08’ you at least had neighborhoods and homes built that would later be populated. For AI the only benefit post crash would be data centers filled with the exact same computing technology we’ve had for a decade. It’ll just be converted to storage and cloud centers rather than whatever an AI center is. This is oligopical levels of cash movements going into a product that doesn’t exist and may never exist. I’d personally rather see this market capitalization going Into something like quantum or economical and scalable nuclear power production. This money isn’t fueling anything, “AI” isn’t providing or creating value anywhere remotely close to its valuation, and the aftermath will see almost nothing valuable come out of it short of like I said big data centers doing the same shit other data centers are already doing.",BreathEcstatic,14,,,2025-10-15 06:31:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6q85l/how_do_we_hedge_against_the_ai_bubble_pop_serious/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6q85l/how_do_we_hedge_against_the_ai_bubble_pop_serious/njkja75/
njkizgp,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Using a synthetic covered call vs. PMCC,"Yeah, it makes sense but IMO it’s not always ideal in practice. A long call  plus short put at the same strike/expiration is synthetically the same as being long 100 shares, so you’re basically recreating stock exposure with margin efficiency, but no real theta edge. You’re just taking on the same delta risk as owning shares and paying more in extrinsic decay for both legs if that makes sense.

The PMCC works better because the long LEAP call gives positive delta with limited downside and the short calls harvest theta aggainst that position. When you use a synthetic share instead, you remove that convexity benefit and introduce assignment and capital complexity without much extra reward.
It’s doable on paper but for most accounts it’s not efficient or scalable compared to just using a standard PMCC or vertical structure if you want defined risk.",TradeVue,2,,,2025-10-15 06:29:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o6xuml/using_a_synthetic_covered_call_vs_pmcc/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o6xuml/using_a_synthetic_covered_call_vs_pmcc/njkizgp/

I skimmed the prospectus. They claim to be 6c-11/18f-4 compliant which would give the ETF presumptive approval which means they wouldn't need SEC approval.

Not exactly sure how - it clearly violates the spirit of the law. I *think* they are doing some financial engineering via a subsidiary.

Even if you blew any of the environmental impact statement and got everything lined up and ready to go it's at least 4-5 years for site prep, construction, standing up the refinery and commissioning.

1o7177q,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. 

I also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). 

Their moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.

iPad: $26.69 B
iPhone: $201.18 B
Mac: $29.98 B
Service: $96.17 B
Wearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B

(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment

Doing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  

In the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to.  I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. 

TLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone 

Edit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.  I was going to make this post about Amazon before I looked at the numbers.

njkb9vz,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Serious question, at what point do you sell your healthy growing stocks?","There will always be pullbacks, but they generally come back up and go even higher. Timing the start of the pullback is nearly impossible, and then trying to time the bottom of the pullback is also nearly impossible. Trying to do both is even harder. If you are investing longterm, then most people just leave it and roll with the ups and downs because the net movement will be up. Don't look at the market or your porfolio all the time, it'll drive you crazy, I'd just check in every few months at the most.

Or, if you are confident that your growing stocks are close to a pullback, you can sell and get other stocks, or if you think the entire market is close to a pullback then you can get out. BUT again, you don't know when or if there will be a pullback, so you may end up missing a bunch of gains for months or longer before the pullback happens, or there may be no major pullback any time soon.

Trust me and others from experience, it's the worst feeling to sell and miss gains. On the other hand, if you don't sell and there's a drop, you have plenty of time for it to come back up.

China is no different from USA in using trade as a tool to coerce other countries.

When South Korea installed THAAD in 2016, China banned Korea cultural products from China for 8 years.

In 2020, China placed tariffs on Australia's exports like wine, beef, coal and lobster. With many still in place today.

The rare earth restrictions is just the latest of using trade as a tool of coercion.

US or China, it's not either one or the other being right or wrong. They BOTH use trade against other countries and are both awful to deal with.

There are very few responsible countries out there when it comes to fair trade.

Even EU, which is considered by many to be one of the better actors, has favorable trade within the bloc versus countries outside.  

The outcome is the same, promoting trade to some countries to the disadvantage of others.

There's no country that can take the moral high ground. In the real world, trade between countries will occur when it is beneficial to both parties.

Is the top of this Pyramid Nvidia? 

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.

njk52at,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Oct 14, 2025","Not even this criminal SCROTUS would rule against “all” tariffs.

A proper and ethical legal reading would rule that how the trump/p2025 Admin is implementing these new and random tariffs is brazenly illegal.  Constitutional standard is crystal clear Congress holds that power, and that the world’s most prolific liar has been (spoiler) lying about the hundreds of “emergencies” behind each fraudulent tariff tweet.  

On the one hand, there’s no reason to think the 6 crooked justices would render that obvious ruling.  They’ve already done insane rulings on “money is speech” and “one specific president has magical immunity” so such a blatantly wrong ruling would just be another day at the office for them.

But game out what happens in the unlikely event they have a rare day of honesty and make the correct ruling: that the tariff terrorist’s random, off the cuff, personal grievance based tariffs are unconstitutional.  

The remedy is fairly simple.  Someone jots down all of his kooky tariff utterances in the form of a bill, sends them to the corrupt Republican House who passes them, then the corrupt Republican Senate does too, and then they are sent to the tariff terrorist himself to be signed into law.  

It’s just a slight detour at worst.  Maybe some legislator or two who is secretly getting money from Uze-becca-becca-becca-stan tinkers with a tariff percent here and there for his co-conspirator.  But effectively it would just be congress clone-approving all of Trump’s random tariffs.  Congress does have that right.

If SCROTUS did accidentally make the correct ruling, they’d stay it for however many weeks it will take for congress to copy and paste his tariffs.  They’d craft some bs that Congress can do this retroactively, saying that this congress would have approved everything anyway, and they’d be right.

Oh and since these tariffs are on our domestic companies and we pay them, they’re just a giant and inefficient non-progressive tax anyway.  GOP massively jacking up taxes, news at 11.

Key Points

* President Donald Trump said his administration is considering “terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil” in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy U.S. soybeans.
* The president’s latest criticism follows a recent spate of critical remarks he has made about China, raising questions about the status of ongoing trade talks and sending stocks careening up and down.
* China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans by far, but it has not bought a single American soybean in months amid an ongoing trade war.

njk1dkl,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Serious question, at what point do you sell your healthy growing stocks?","I would like to present a hypothetical 

 i have a fund just to mess around in the stock market. Separate from my savings.

I entered with 33% of it in google on a hunch its under valued and im up 50% As of now. However the way i see it because of google’s giant size and the fact it doesn’t seem reasonable to make such extreme gains again i might just sell. Why? Because after such a rise and its market size its much more likely to drop than it is to go up.

And the important question is what’s the alternative right? Well statistically it seems smarter to me to move the money to a stock that over the last year did no have this boom yet is a healthy stock that could go up with the market/rise on its own.

Basically im statistically more likely to lose on my current position in google than with a stock that didn’t make such a jump this year (given i dont pick a stupid stock lets say a solid pick not a crystal ball one)

So in this situation isnt it smarter for me to reinvest? My money is still with the market but not in a recently rocketed stock

Edit: btw i did this a few times sold NVDA at 550% (no brag just luck) boeing at 10% google 15% in the past.

Point im trying to make or even ask is isnt selling after you had significant gains smarter because its statistically less likely to make “big gains” twice in a stock?

As for losses, i only buy stocks i believe are safe bagholds (top snp 500) i have yet to sell at a loss over a few years because i just wait

njk09zy,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How do we hedge against the AI bubble pop? (Serious discussion only),"1. Hedge outside the port. Have a medical degree or a job that keeps paying during a downturn.
2. Uncorrelated assets. Have something that won’t be affected by the crash. The problem is that you need a couple since we never know what becomes correlated and what doesn’t for a given crash (so gold, bonds, managed futures etc). The bigger the crash, the more shit becomes correlated and liquidity gets fucked. Allows dip buying. 
2a negatively correlated assets. Self explanatory.
2b cash. 
3. Pair trade. Go long AI you believe in, short AI you don’t. 
4. Vol products, if AI goes down it’s taking the market with it, vix, spy puts, variance swaps etc.
5. Straight up hedges. So puts on the underlying security/ETF etc.
6. Hedges via vol on negatively correlated assets/black swan potential causes or consequence of that specific black swan. So if you think the unwinding of the yen carry trade is a risk, options on the yen with tons of Vega (far out in time and strike). If china trade war, trade calls on MP/rare earths. Trump firing Powell/central bank shit (cause) puts on in bonds, fed saving the day after the crash (consequence) calls on bonds. Flight to safety after a crash, calls on USD or gold.
7. Leveraged dip buying. Access to leverage to use less capital (so having less hedges) to buy a dip/rebuild your port. Either margin account, use of leveraged ETFs, options when the dip happens.
8. Use options to gain leveraged exposure. Dominated if having 100k of stock, you have 20-25k of options, so if there’s more than a 25% drawdown, you can’t lose anymore than the option value. This costs theta, but does give you return convexity.

As a rule, hedging is a drag on the port. Number option/having a medical degree is probably the exception, but uncorrelated assets (number 2)  have been called the “only free lunch” in investing. 5% to gold has been a good idea, I like managed futures (even if not having a great year), BRK is kinda the anti tech of investing and good diversification, international equities, dividend stock etc.

3. Is real tricky, kinda hard to execute.

4/5  Is a good option for an “all in one” to protect a massive crash, but it will cost you long term, you can structure it so it only kicks it for extreme events. 

6. By far the best options and the cleverest, but you need a very very good understanding of macro, and that’s the thing with black swans, no one sees them coming.

7. Works well for small dips AND you think there’s an imminent recovery.

8. Combines well with the other ideas, but needs active management and understating of IV and skew. Won’t always work, so you’ll miss out on some rallies, but you’ll capture some others ones 2-4X.

Personally what I’ve done is use to options to get spy exposure, frees up 70-80% of the port for other stuff. Have a bunch of uncorrelated assets (directly or via options). Some of these are hedges, but give returns in their own right (ie gold lately). Adjust the spy options via gamma levels, IV% and indicators like Cor1M. Have some “lateral hedges”, these probably won’t pay out, but are very convex and capital efficient, but not a compete drag on the port since they could pay out anyways: (MP options or stock, TLT options, simplify has ETFs like RFIX and Pfix).

1-2% in direct hedges for extreme drawdown, this is just a loss on the ports performance long term. You don’t need as much since your losses are limited to whatever you had in options on spy or AI ir whatever.  Then use the buy the dip trick (use short dated ITm calls to avoid Vega) for small downturns and avoid the extreme cost of hedging these.",OwnVehicle5560,19,,,2025-10-15 04:16:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6q85l/how_do_we_hedge_against_the_ai_bubble_pop_serious/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6q85l/how_do_we_hedge_against_the_ai_bubble_pop_serious/njk09zy/

Willow Lane Acquisition Corp. will merge with Boost Run Holdings, LLC. The combined company will be named Boost Run, Inc. and will be a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

* **What is Boost Run:**  Boost Run is a startup that provides AI cloud infrastructure and high-performance computing, primarily through bare-metal infrastructure for customers to access Nvidia GPUs. 
* **Merger details:**  The transaction is a de-SPAC merger, meaning Boost Run will become a publicly traded company through the combination with the existing special purpose acquisition company, Willow Lane. 
* **Timeline:**  The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder approval.
* Is Boost Run PROFITABLE ?
* Yes, Boost Run has a history of being profitable. The AI cloud infrastructure company has operated profitably while funding its own growth, without having raised a Series A, B, or C round of venture capital. 

Financial highlights reported by Boost Run as part of its merger with Willow Lane Acquisition Corp. include: 

* **High adjusted EBITDA margins**: The company projects adjusted EBITDA margins of over 75% for 2025.
* **High-teens free cash flow margins**: Boost Run also projects high-teens free cash flow margins for 2025.
* **Projected 2025 revenue growth**: Revenue for 2025 is projected to grow over 250% compared to 2024. 

These figures underscore Boost Run's capital-efficient business model and strong unit economics. The merger with Willow Lane will provide the company with additional cash to accelerate its growth plans. 

CEO is experienced?

Yes, Andrew Karos, the founder and CEO of Boost Run, has a strong and relevant track record of experience. Before founding Boost Run, his background was in building high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure for the financial industry, which is directly applicable to AI cloud computing. 

Highlights of Andrew Karos's experience include:

* **Co-founder of Blue Fire Capital:** In 2007, Karos co-founded this global algorithmic trading firm, which he grew to operate across 13 data centers and seven countries, generating over $500 million in revenue.
* **Head of Electronic Trading at Galaxy Digital:** After Blue Fire was acquired by Galaxy Digital in 2020, Karos served as the Head of Electronic Trading, where he expanded Galaxy's trading and computing infrastructure.
* **Expertise in HPC and AI:** The experience of building and operating low-latency HPC infrastructure for algorithmic trading gave Karos a deep understanding of the economics and demands of high-availability, purpose-built computing for AI and HPC applications. 

When he self-funded Boost Run in 2023, he brought his experienced team from Blue Fire and Galaxy with him, including his Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO). This collective expertise gives the company a foundation of deep hardware, software, cybersecurity, operational, and financial knowledge. 

= the company currently has over 75% adjusted EBITDA margins profitabilty

An adjusted EBITDA margin over 75% is exceptionally high and suggests a company is extremely profitable and efficient at managing its operating costs. For many industries, a margin above 10% is considered good, and anything over 20–25% is often considered excellent.

1o6yepl,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"AI may be a bubble, but the sentiment in China is different - Why I am bullish on Chinese AI ($KWEB Overview)","***This is my personal research and opinion, not professional financial advice. I am not a licensed financial advisor. Please conduct your own research and consult qualified professionals before making investment decisions. Note: I hold options for $KWEB, and am likely to hold the underlying soon.*** 

As you know, the stock market trends heavily based on vibes. Sure, a companies fundies plays a part, but at the end of the day sentiment rules the market. 

In the United States, people are very fearful about AI. The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. 

Recently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. 

To me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: 

>The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are ""very excited"" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.

96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA. Here's what [Pew has found in surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/): 

* 50% say they’re more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, up from 37% in 2021.
* 10% are more excited than concerned.
* 38% say they’re equally excited and concerned.

That's a big difference. 

So what does that have to do with the market. 

I present to you $KWEB, KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF. 

In their words: 

>KWEB is a China ETF that tracks the [CSI Overseas China Internet Index](https://www.investing.com/indices/csi-overseas-china-internet), which consists of China based companies whose primary business or businesses are focused on internet and internet-related technology. The Index is free float market capitalization weighted and includes publicly traded securities on either the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market, or New York Stock Exchange.

KWEB's top holdings are positioned to benefit from China's optimism regarding AI: 

1. **Alibaba Group** \- Major AI cloud provider, with AI-related revenues achieving triple-digit growth​
2. **Tencent Holdings**  \- Third-largest AI public cloud services provider in China​
3. **PDD Holdings**  \- E-commerce platform leveraging AI for recommendations
4. **JD Dot Com** \- Advanced logistics and AI-driven operations​
5. **Baidu** \- China's leading search engine with significant AI investments

What about regulation? Regulators are approaching AI companies with more[ amicable intentions. ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/10/1091044/china-tech-regulation-angela-zhang/)There's a fear that approaching these companies with harsh intentions will result in significant economic pushback.

So what are the risks here? 

1. The ETF is volatile. It's not completely shielded from our own economics happenings. 
2. Trade tensions between the US and China has affected the strength of the ETF's holdings
3. Any currency fluctuations that may occur can have an affect on performance. 

Overall, the optimism behind AI in China, the soft approach to regulation, and [stimulus factors](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/macro/chinas-bold-stimulus-measures-what-it-means-for-markets-25092024) make me feel pretty good about this industry.

Your best option for such short term is to invest into Hungarian HUF bonds, 6-7% yearly and its tax free.  
(you can sell it whenever you want for 1% fee or buy DKJ)

(Other option would be to put the money on trading212 and they will pay 5% on huf just to store there, but you have to pay tax on in, i dont see any benefit)  
Other option is to put it into an EUR based MMF funds that will yield around 2-3% per year, but again, close to 30% tax on that, so you will effective get only 1.5-2% per year so its not recommended over huf bonds  
(unless you think the huf will significantly weaken over the next 2-3 year, as in over yearly 7%)

Although its not recommended short term, I would likely put 1/3-1/2 of that money into an all world ETF like VWCE (i dont trust that much in the government and i believe HUF will weaken after the election next year), which can be considered safe (at least not worse then bank offered scams) and the other half / 2/3 i would buy Hungarian bonds (not through bank as they have unnecessary fee, but through MÁK)",Green_Dragon9,1,,,2025-10-15 03:48:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o67jj9/15k_doing_nothing_on_my_bank_account_whats_the/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o67jj9/15k_doing_nothing_on_my_bank_account_whats_the/njjvs1q/

1o6y5l5,post,dividends,AVGO,Broadcom Inc.,Trust account investing for disabled.,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if I could get some people’s opinions on the best way to invest for my disabled Uncle. Backstory is basically he got 23,000 and some change when we sold my grandmother‘s house but prior to this he broke his hip so he’s been in and probably never get out of long-term care. That said, he was also told he was never gonna walk when he was younger and he’s walked all his life so he could still get out. I’m not doubting that. Back to the question at hand. The money had to be put into a trust to protect his Social Security and other benefits that way his name isn’t on anything because he can’t have any assets all that blah blah blah. Other than this $23,000 he owns nothing I want to invest this for him the best I can in case he ever needs this money for medical expenses or whatever when and if he ever gets out of here. On a more selfish note I’m also his only heir so I would like to invest it smartly because if none of this has been used on him while he’s alive,then it does go to me.  I thought of a few different ways to do this, but one of my main concerns is that I know a corrections coming soon or at least at some point the market can’t go up this long and not have some sort of a correction. I know in the long run 10 or 20 years down the road it’s not gonna matter if there’s a correction and I bought it the wrong time or not. Either way I thought of doing it you know 5000 now and 1000 every two months or whatever it may be until it’s all allocated where it needs to be or something along the lines instead of all at once. Where I put it as a big questions. Leaning towards growth dividend. Avgo,txn,lmt,nee o vym schd icln rtx duk or similar. With this back tested aggressive triples in 10 years with 3-4 % yield. Also thinking simple and go svol schd qqqi spyi sphy. I would just like some other views and opinions if you have a moment. He has a regular savings account as well. I was thinking of keepih what he has in there now which is only a few hundred and any big gains over the next year or 2 I’ll have transferred into that account for quick access to cash if needed. No more than 1500 I am thinking. Thank you in advance.

1o6xuml,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Using a synthetic covered call vs. PMCC,"We all know the poor man’s covered call, purchasing a leap and selling OTM calls on a regular basis. This strategy requires considerable capital, less than owning 100 shares, but still. For instance, I currently am running the strategy on AMD with Jan28 150$ as my leap. This costed me 96$ to build. 

Has anyone done the same long term strategy of selling calls, but instead of a leap or the underlying shares, building a synthetic share. By purchasing a ATM leap call and selling and ATM put with the same expiration, you’ve build a synthetic share with limited theta because of the time frame. This would cost about 25-26$ for the same timeframe. You could then sell calls at the same frequency.

Does this make any sense?

Right now most of there customers are utilities that have purchased small systems to test for integration. They're marketing to utilities as a base load but the tech could be scaled down for residential in the future.

The problem is just getting the word out and getting customers. At first they were marketing a packaged unit that was ready to go aside final connections on site and a foundation pad. Recently marketing has changed to larger scale with more site construction with components. Duration and power output can be scaled separately unlike lithium which would be more attractive at larger scales. The components for the system are made from materials that are readily available and not subject to market swings or trade policy relations.

njjbhk9,comment,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Is Microsoft going to be effected in any long term way with Xbox basically trying to hang itself with a golden noose,"Console are loss leaders. Microsoft and Sony hardly make profit on consoles; they often lose money on console so they can lock you into their ecosystem. In November 2022, Phil Spencer said that Microsoft looses about $100-200 for every Xbox sold. 

They're sold near or below cost while games, subscriptions, DLC, and accessories are sold at markups for profit. (Nintendo does sell consoles for a profit, just different strategies.)

Getting rid of consoles would boost the profitability of the gaming division, benefitting Microsoft

Also, just by simply mathematics, boosting the gamepass subscription by 50% can only harm them if they lose 33% or more of customers.

(Serious discussion only),"Precision pumpkins maintain a 1:4.7 seed-to-pulp ratio with strict stem-to-plant mass compliance (0.08-0.12 coefficient).

Stem orientation is non-negotiable for futures delivery - precision pumpkins require 87° stem cant at harvest with less than 3° deviation. Big stem small plant phenotypes get rejected at grading due to improper hydraulic pressure ratios during growth phase - you need that 6:1 plant-to-stem mass ratio minimum or your gourd fails USDA volumetric compliance testing.

So why has it been running like mad? I think the market is pricing in an  announcement from Sam and openai.

Open ai is in the midst of a massive data center build out(stargate), and he's announcing deals, investments, partnerships left and right.  With the recent one from Broadcom.

But will he announce a partnership with OKLO? Market thinks so or it could be a big Dud if there is no announcement. 

If there is an announcement of a deal, investment or partnership, my prediction is OKLO is heading to 100 billion market cap over the coming years.

1o6ulpa,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"Palantir , Why Retail Lose 90percent of the time","AI- The statistic that ""90 percent of retail traders lose"" is a widely cited rule of thumb in the trading community, and is largely supported by industry data and academic research. While the exact number varies by study and market, studies consistently show that a significant majority of individual traders lose money over the long term. 

Wallstreets job is to sell stocks to you on the highs and buy at the lows. Palantir found many buyers looking for the next Nvidia, but Palantir is not even close to being a Nvidia. ironically the AI superpower Nvidia is trading 12x under the PE of Palantir. Keep all that in mind when you take a gander at both companies financials’s. 

Palantir is ONLY profitable because of those government contracts. If a Democrat wins in 3 years and doesn’t like that Alex Karp a Foreigner, Israeli zionists genocidal elite who has access to confidential information in our military you can say goodbye to profitability. 


My issue is that Palantir in profits has 220million, but why is the stock valued at 450Billion? That’s 2000x what the company is currently profitable in, 620x trialing PE. 


Palantir and seemingly anything Peter Thiel is attached to has had exponential growth this year…it’s a weaker case but if you look at say BMNR or PLTR it’s starting to look like a crypto inspired pump and dumb scheme 
 
Palantir is not for investors, it’s for people who don’t understand investing and definitionally just got lucky, in reality 60-70 should’ve been the height but we’re all so desensitized given the euphoria 

A stock like this is very clearly definitionally a pyramid scheme (not ponzi) 
It’s not based on logic that Palantir goes up, just rampant speculation.

njj3ois,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"PhD salary & savings: Germany (Braunschweig) vs Sweden (Chalmers, Göteborg) — what would I save in Sweden?","I do not have answers to your question, but I have meta-comments as someone who did a PhD and has grey hair now.

You do not want to save money during your PhD. What are you saving 2k a month during your PhD for? I am really not the guy who goes around burning money on nonsense, but I am always for quality of life even if that means saving less and especially if it is completely logical. You will hopefully earn significantly more money after your PhD than during it, it makes no sense to be super frugal during your PhD. Save some money just in order to build the habit, but it seems you don't lack that.

I was not super frugal but I was checking my balance often and was proud how much I saved.. and I save that kind of money in no time now, the PhD savings were completely pointless. I remember debating whether I have enough money to go see the Led Zeppelin reunion concert - I was incredibely naive to think that I'd be able to get the tickets if I decided to - and I decided against it because it was too expensive.. man I would have never forgiven myself for that decision if I didn't know that there was no way I would have gotten those tickets in the first place. I was thinking whether I can afford a better room and decided to go for it - best decision during my PhD, the money difference is just a drop in the ocean and it made my life significantly better for 5 years.

In short - given you have enough money to live and kind of emergency fund (or fallback to parents if need be) - that's all you need, forget about money. Pick the place where you do your PhD based on where you want to do it, what project is more interesting to you, what advisor is better, what kind of a place is it for your social needs. Don't skimp on important stuff like rent, good quality food, excercise, mattress, computer & chair, and socializing/girlfriend/general fun.

Congratulations on your offers and good luck choosing!

P.S. You're already in a financially better position, I did my PhD in the UK where PhDs are paid like crap, and you are not an employee so you get no pension for those periods..

njj1z2d,comment,investing,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Which small-cap is doing something actually unique?,"I had tried to post something about this in another subreddit, but had it taken down due to the market cap. That said I think it’s a genuinely solid hypothesis:

Apple recently announced they are steering resources away from the VR headset towards AR style glasses.

https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2025/10/02/apple-shelves-vision-headset-revamp-to-prioritize-meta-like-ai-glasses/

This is following the success of META’s glasses that are getting very favorable reception and reviews. META glasses use a neural band as their primary input device, developed by a company they acquired called CTRL labs. META paid between $500m and $1b for that acquisition.

Apple is going to need to develop an interface for their glasses, and unless they plan to reinvent the wheel that means an acquisition.

WLDS holds a patent titled ""Gesture and Voice-Controlled Interface Device” which covers proprietary technology that enables measurement of weight, torque, and force directly from wrist-based sensors. This patent was recently granted, and is significantly broader than any held by META related to this technology.

In addition to the strong and growing patent portfolio, WLDS actually already makes a product.

https://mudra-band.com/products/mudra-band-for-apple-watch

They sell a gesture and voice controlled interface device designed to work with the Apple Watch. Overall reviews are decent, though it definitely needs some refinement to slap an Apple logo on it.

If Apple is pivoting to smart glasses, and needs to make an acquisition to accelerate their progress and catch up with META, then WLDS is a top contender among potential acquisition candidates. They holds relevant patents, and makes an actual product designed to interface with Apple devices. We know META paid at least $500m to make their entry into the space, and as of this writing the market cap of WLDS is maybe $20m. CTRL labs had raised a total of $67m in funding prior to acquisition, but had no commercial products.

Will Apple acquire WLDS? Who knows. Will Apple risk infringing their patent and getting sued? Doubtful, it’d be a lot cheaper to buy them (see Red v Nikon). Will Apple build an entirely new product from scratch? No. To the best of my knowledge there is nobody else in the space further in development, and even spending 10x their market cap would cost less than half of what Meta paid for CTRL labs. This is obviously a gamble, but I think it’s a good one.",Fictional-adult,6,,,2025-10-15 00:47:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o6tdmh/which_smallcap_is_doing_something_actually_unique/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o6tdmh/which_smallcap_is_doing_something_actually_unique/njj1z2d/

njixjk0,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How do we hedge against the AI bubble pop? (Serious discussion only),"Puts on Spy is the most straight-forward option, as the SP500 is tech-oriented. You could also try calls on VIX, as that index measures broad economic sentiment. Vix options are relatively cheaper than Index options, so its easier to build a comprehensive strategy than just hedging SPY. The challenge is VIX only peaks during the day or two of the crash, then it deflates rapidly. You need to watch the news and pull as soon as Black Swan is officially called.

Tbh you're right to have some concern regarding gold, as the price typically drops during the onset of a financial crash, be it recession or depression, but historically Gold then rallys for the long term after a few months post-crash 

The difficult part, assuming you're talking about Gold futures/derivatives, is timing the market right before the crash to preserve the liquidity.

TL;DR Long puts on market index is the simplest option, but I'd consider combining with VIX calls to maximize the profit. Go long on a couple SPY Puts for a small liquid hedge, but be aggressive on VIX calls to profit from the Black Swan. Then wait to pick up Gold futures for the long term rally after bottoming out.

1o6t9dk,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is Cooking Oil trade the new Rare Metal trade? (ADM),"https://preview.redd.it/bl6kufqch5vf1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a15fa4da5bc7b123eadd5ebad3e9f6d0ba0221

**1. Background**

I'm guessing you all saw Taco's brand new post about retaliating against China for not buying U.S. soybeans. Basically he's saying that U.S. can just make our own cooking oil. Low and behold, the market plummeted right after the post in fears of a new tariff battle. Buuuuut, after seeing what happened to the rare metal stocks, I was thinking.... **Maybe we could use this to rake in some profits**

**2. Company**

There are two companies that stand to significantly profit from this

**Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)** and **Bungee Global (BG)**

Both companies are farming & food processing companies that have various types of vegetable oils as a key product in their portfolio. BG has a lower market cap (and may experience greater rise in stock price) and a lower pe ratio, but I ended up choosing ADM for the following reasons.

a) ADM towers over BG in terms of their Domestic (US) manufacturing capacity. (With the rampaging tariffs and Trump's US-first mindset, this one is the most critical imo)

b) ADM's supply chain for the raw materials are much better than BG, which has to buy its materials from companies like ADM

If trade tensions escalate and the U.S. moves toward domestic production, ADM essentially becomes the **default national supplier**. It’s the agricultural equivalent of a defense stock or rare metal stock.

**3. Financial Overview (ADM)**

\- 2024 revenue: around $93 billion

\- Operating income: roughly $4 billion

\- Forward P/E: about 11x

\- Dividend yield: roughly 3.3%

\- ADM operates one of the largest soybean & vegetable processing networks in the world

\- ADM looks fine chart-wise as well. It's not at a historic high like many other stocks nowadays and is back on the rise after a 2-year long decline from 2023

https://preview.redd.it/co4p8yh1i5vf1.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=61116dd54e54d84c7b5ee289cfbb362e895bab86

**4. My Take**

**I’ve just YOLOed my entire portfolio into ADM at the end of the market today (300k USD)**. If it lives up to 1/10 of the rare metal hype, it should easily reach its historic high at $99. After that, it's no one's guess.

Luckily, the price has been spiking in the last 20 minutes of the market today & the after market. Let's see where this takes us.",kku3430,401,0.9,159.0,2025-10-15 00:03:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t9dk/is_cooking_oil_trade_the_new_rare_metal_trade_adm/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t9dk/is_cooking_oil_trade_the_new_rare_metal_trade_adm/

**Executive Summary:** 

Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. 

**Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains**

Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys).

Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security).

**Revenue Acceleration Levers**

Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services).

To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics.

**Technology Roadmap & Differentiation**

Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this:

* Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft.
* Drone/UAV structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical).
* Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream.

Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere.

Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables.

**Strategic Positioning in Drones/UAVs**

Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to UAV endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered UAV with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market.

[Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk)

[Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) 

Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale.

[Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) 

As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET.  

**AI in print process optimization**

Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware.

**TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:**

* Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified.
* Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware.
* Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA).
* Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally      (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production.
* Drones & UAVs - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing
* AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat

njiqkpv,comment,options,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),10K to 1M in 1 trade (Back testing OTM Calls),"Google ""data snooping"". 

Buying long OTM options tends not to be profitable, overall, because options tend to be priced efficiently due to arbitrage. 

OTM calls on stocks that are good bets to take off, like most long options, are priced so the overall risk/reward doesn't work like you hope it will, because when they're not priced that way, big-money whales and high-frequency traders, who have faster access and better information than you or I, buy them, raising the price until they are. 

So, as a retail trader, it's like buying a lottery ticket. If you or I hit a big jackpot on 1 out of 100 of those long options trades, then our average loss will be most likely be at least ~1.1% of that jackpot, for a net breakeven at best, before trading fees. The market settles on prices that ensure that. The big options clearing houses make money for a reason. 

Sure, yes, some retail traders do get lucky and beat the odds, just like some people win the lottery. But many don't, and overall, over many trades and traders, buying long and holding to expiration works out not to be an edge.(And remember, when listening to success stories on reddit, you're getting an incomplete picture, because not that many people get on social media to brag about their losses.) 

Also be aware ThinkBack's fills are unrealistic, and sometimes, options spreads don't fill at all, even with market orders. I've totally had market orders sit there in OnDemand and just never fill. 

ThinkBack is good for getting a sense but don't be fooled into thinking your results on ThinkBack are what would have happened if you had placed those same trades in real time. 

I'm not trying to be discouraging. I do believe it's possible to find an edge, and worth the effort.

1o6qwae,post,stocks,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,American Battery Technology Company (ABAT) quietly building a U.S. lithium recycling powerhouse,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been digging into American Battery Technology Company (ABAT) lately, and I think this one deserves way more attention than it’s getting.

With the renewed U.S. China tariff tensions, Washington is pushing hard to rebuild domestic control over critical minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. 80% of global lithium refining happens in China. That’s a huge strategic vulnerability for the U.S. and Europe. Tariffs and supply disruptions have reminded everyone that if you can’t refine it yourself, you’re at someone else’s mercy so it seems. That’s exactly where ABAT fits in in my opinion.

They’re an American company building American lithium capacity, supported by U.S. grants and policy. Their work directly aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act’s push for U.S. sourced battery materials, and that could mean long-term funding, tax incentives, and federal partnerships. With the current tariff issue with China, its helping ABAT’s positioning, pushing investment and attention toward homegrown battery material companies.

They’re basically trying to close the full loop of the U.S. battery supply chain from recycling spent batteries, to extracting lithium from domestic resources to refining battery-grade materials. In a world that’s moving fast toward EVs and energy storage, that’s a pretty unique position.

* Revenues are actually starting to ramp Q4 FY25 revenue up over 180% QoQ, showing their recycling operations are gaining traction.
* Operating costs down 30% YoY, meaning they’re tightening efficiency while scaling.
* Strong U.S. government support, multiple DOE grants + a $900M Letter of Interest from U.S. EXIM Bank for their Tonopah Flats lithium project.
* Added to the Russell 2000 index, which brings more institutional visibility.

ABAT is building infrastructure that America actually needs if it wants to compete in lithium and battery materials. Their focus on sustainable recycling + domestic lithium refining could put them in a sweet spot as demand skyrockets and the U.S. pushes for local supply chains.

They’ve been through the cash burn and early stage pain already, but management seems to be getting costs under control and executing better lately.

They’re not profitable yet and still rely on external funding - but for a small-cap with government backing, real assets, and visible progress, it feels like the risk/reward looks promising given the above in my opinion.

If they can get Tonopah Flats into production and keep growing recycling throughput, this could evolve from a microcap story to a serious U.S. battery materials player over the next few years in my opinion.

Curious if anyone else is following ABAT or has thoughts on their Tonopah project? I’m long, holding. Would love to hear other DD or perspectives from people in the battery/materials space.

Not financial advice and always do your own reasearch / DD. Good luck! :D",wevs007,52,0.83,31.0,2025-10-14 22:32:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6qwae/american_battery_technology_company_abat_quietly/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6qwae/american_battery_technology_company_abat_quietly/

1o6pa3g,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market,"Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.

Revenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.

Strategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.",RadiantLife3731,0,0.29,5.0,2025-10-14 21:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/

It's like a circle of investment money but right now it's not generating the profits. That's very similar to how the internet and computers and whatnot were in the 90s. People were beginning to see the productivity but the valuations ran so far ahead of any potential return that we had a 10 year reset. AI seems to be on the same track but the difficult part is figuring out how big the bubble gets blown before people say okay, when is the money going to come, that's actually the trigger you look for, when the narrative switches to overall business profitability, meaning small businesses, meaning car manufacturers, meaning everyone, how much money is AI actually making them, when that becomes the focus, that would be a trigger for a potential reset or at least a sideways market.

OKLO's main innovation is the business plan - financing nuclear reactors WITHOUT state or federal funds, and working with the guvment to cut red tape associated with nuclear fuel refinement, possession, transportation, etc. OKLO is somewhat uniquely positioned for success because they already have a contract with the state of Idaho to sell Idaho the electricity produced in their first reactor.

There is a time for capital preservation (being risk averse) and there is a time for capital accumulation (being courageous).

Know your time horizon because it will factor into your ability to take hits because high risk high reward plays can be flat for half a decade or even more so you have to commit to DCA'ing no matter what to let that compounding explode.",footyfan92,3,,,2025-10-14 20:51:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o3xom5/sp_500_vs_ftse_allworld_which_do_you_prefer_and/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o3xom5/sp_500_vs_ftse_allworld_which_do_you_prefer_and/njhsw4g/

njhq3ma,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How much should an 18yr old invest?,"18 is an amazing age to start investing. My advice would be to keep as little as possible (only what you really need in an emergency or if you know you'll need to spend a large-ish sum soon) in savings. Keeping your money in a savings account is sort of like investing in an ETF that loses 2% of its value every year. Not a good deal. At 18 and with a LONG or VERY LONG time horizon, investing in one or several decent broad market ETFs is arguably LESS risky for your capital (maybe try to explain that to your mum).

I saw some people who mentioned investing ""in you"". Sure... if you're funding your own education. But if, like many Europeans your age, education in your country is relatively cheap and your parents still support you financially, there really is probably no point in saving much. My point is don't save just for the sake of saving. Save for stuff you'll really NEED. Also, if you only move out once you've got a proper job again, you might not need much more than your income at that time. 

At any rate, do start investing ASAP. You're in a fantastic position at 18. Also make sure you're informed enough but don't overthink it (as long as you go for broad market ETFs; picking stocks is a different story). Understand that TIME really is your best friend here and what will really make a difference. Also you're so young you can make some mistakes and correct the trajectory later. Older people need to be very careful. You have many decades ahead of you.

I'm 30 years old, average salary, cash poor but 330,000 in assets built from zero. Started with mutual funds via the bank, then ETFs with a broker, then started picking stocks which is what accelerated the growth of my portfolio significantly.

Buffet indicator is well past historic highs 

Retail has been conditioned to buy the dip

Greed is everywhere and look no further than Palantir

Retail investors are the most leveraged and are participating in markets at record highs… very bad signal 

Palantir has a 620Pe ratio and 22.2percent profit ability. 

You as an investor are paying 600$ for 1$ of the company today and believe they’ll grow into it. mathematically go ahead and tell me when? If Palantir lost 10x its stock value, it’d still have an overpriced but appropriate value.

Did you miss that? It’ll take more than 10 years for this company to just be very expensive…

Markets correct and nobody can time them, everyone thinks they’re the smartest in the bull run for having “weak hands” but these people will be the true bag holders that are scarred when the bear market happens 

Historically companies with a 300+ PE typically last 1 year before a staggering 99.9 percent correct 

Best of luck investors, if you’re buying Palantir at 180..you just need to read about stocks and history of them. Don’t take offense but you should educate yourself on what has an can happen

1o6mibk,post,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Someone Explain Why I am Right / Wrong,"Hi,

I have a considerable amount of money which is in the S&P 500 and I am thinking about taking it out.

My current thoughts are that the S&P 500 is turning into a massive bubble being held up by a few of the biggest AI companies who are bleeding money year on year with essentially no hope of ever getting returns to offset how much they have invested into AI.

Nvidia is making massive investments (billions of dollars) seemingly everywhere, encouraging companies to build data centres packed with their GPUs. To me, this doesn’t seem sustainable. It feels like the market is treating these companies as if they’ve discovered an infinite money glitch, with valuations climbing endlessly. But unless someone figures out how to generate truly massive revenue from AI in the near future, I don’t see how this can continue.

Therefore I want to take my money out of the S&P 500 soon and store it in gold as a stable asset that I believe will continue to rise in value as people look to store there money in safer assets.

The answer is clearly manipulation of retail investors. Make a stock unkillable which will create an investor superman syndrome. The issue is eventually they run out of suckers.

620 PE ratio for a companies profit margin increasing at 22.2 %is insane 
Compound the fact that the stock went up 330percent in a year and you see the picture.

You’ll pay 600$ for what the company can give back today in 600years……

If Palantir magically went down by 10x it’d still have 60PE 

Good luck Palantir Investors…this will fail eventually once the Manipulation comes to light or runs outta funding to artificially  inflate/deflate the stock 

Edit: before I have to hear it. Yes Palantir is an exceptional company, yes what they’re doing is great

Would I tell someone to pay 620Pe ratio for Palantir? Absolutely not and that’s dumb. People do realize Future PE is being used to get more people not to question is Palantir at a fair

History shows even 300PE ratio’s do not last long and are very rare /short lived 

Palantir is priced to perfection. One accounting error could spark fraud

A new government may not want Palantir 

If the economy goes down which is very likely given we’re at historic highs even break several records. 

In 3 years This stock will not survive being priced to perfection. It could crash tomorrow it could crash in 2 years…but it will be weighed and judged like Jeff bezos said

My point is that you can think of the dominant motivation (and exposures) for the trade by taking the spread width to extremes. At the lower limit, a combination of very narrow CS with very narrow PS is a pure terminal distribution bet - both CS and PS start acting as digital options with very little outright vega or gamma. At the upper limits, a combination of very wide CS and wide PS is essentially a strangle which is a pure vol bet (as long strikes can be ignored) and you're going to have actual vega and gamma exposures.

but open ai is one of the companies that aren’t doing this, they are surviving on debt, selling equity for raises, and small revenue

Should ai usage prove to be incapable of generating actual income or productivity for companies, then sure, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc will still do fine, they might take a hit to their share price, but they make money from other sources so at the end of the day it won’t be doomsday for them

Feelings 100% do matter, psychology is a valid science and explains why people do things.  Not stressing about a mortgage is a valuable thing psychologically.  

2. You can argue about interest rates, but investing in the stock market has risk.  Paying off your mortgage immediately removes that expense (still need to pay for insurance and potentially taxes).

njh7wv5,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Yeah, that’s the unquestionable downside. You could also mitigate market risk (though not diversification risk) by putting reinvested amounts into something safe / inversely correlated with tech stocks.

My personal view is that Apple/Nvidia are going to be substantially more volatile than other parts of the market, but will likely perform well over the midterm. I would personally probably tolerate the added risk for sake of tax efficiency, especially if I was in a position of not having to sell if there was a 2-3 year downturn. You could also split the difference some, and do an initial larger sale this year and next year, staying within the 15% fed gains, and do more gradual tax efficient sell down from there. 

Another thought — I’m not sure what you said you were holding in your tax sheltered account, but if a decent amount of it is in an S&P 500 type fund, it has an outsized holding in big tech. You can also diversify by moving some of that into a diversified fund which isn’t highly overweight big tech, which is a completely tax free way to add more sector diversity. 

Final thought is make sure your wife is maxing out IRA contrib and any workplace retirement plan to substantially reduce taxable income from her.",Mistakesweremade1974,1,,,2025-10-14 19:08:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njh7wv5/

njh5e53,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,What’s if there are no stock crash anytime soon,"There's that and the nature and speed of trading itself is changing incrementally.

Consider trading and liquidity windows shortening because of digital/security improvements.  It used to be a week, then 2 days, then 1 day.  Pretty soon this will be within the same day, and then instantaneous.  Frequency and liquidity affects profits.  If the system is operating faster and more liquid with trades and money, there are small-subtle improvements to returns.  Provided everything is secure, and stable and trustworthy.  Which is why it's been so slow to change, but it is changing.

That's just one element of many.  Consider crypto markets.  By default they trade at a super accelerated rate, they're 24/7.  They don't stop for anything, not weekends or holidays.  Relative to the S&P 500, crypto is 7-10% of its total size.  It's ""infected"" the traditional markets incrementally, with ETFs and attempts to legitimize this new trading.  And it is new, afaik it's never been like this in the history of trading ever, at least not at this scale.

Personally I don't believe in crypto as an asset class.  I think it's a scam waiting to fall on its face.  Whether that's true or not is irrelevant, I can't deny it's changing the nature of trading.  This is part of the reason why traditional markets are moving faster, it has to so it can adapt to more aggressive 24/7 markets.  So changes like this might be a slow burn, could be fractional percentages of change or maybe 1% shifts at the outside, but several frequency and digital trading changes like this shift returns upward.

The reason is simple math.  The market is up 70% of the time.  Increase that to 6 days a week with same day purchase windows and the frequency of uptime increases.  This in turn increases return rates each year.  I'll concede maintaining a 70% success rate requires trust and validation in the system, but that's why these changes are relatively slow and incremental.  The system is cautious and validating these more aggressive changes, once they are verified as working they go into effect and change the nature of trading.

AI trading is accelerating as well.  Algorithmic trades are already a thing and have been for a while, but it's about to get a lot more intelligent and dynamic, and complex decisions will come faster.  This will also need excessive amounts of validation, but it points towards a future where the S&P is traded 24/7 and very aggressively at all hours of the day.  This will be a profit machine that will benefit lots of people in ways we can't completely see yet.  And yes, risks abound.  Centralization, rich get richer, etc.  But as you point out retail investment has exploded with new tools and ease of use, fintechs and so on.  The trendline is towards democratization, lots of people have different reasons to want to get involved.  This is why I'm not worried so much.",fatheadlifter,1,,,2025-10-14 18:56:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o64lm0/whats_if_there_are_no_stock_crash_anytime_soon/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o64lm0/whats_if_there_are_no_stock_crash_anytime_soon/njh5e53/

1o6kly4,post,stocks,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Investing direct on foreign exchange vs foreign ordinary shares (F-shares) locally?,"For context, I'm a USA investor. For those investing in a few foreign companies they find interesting, do you prefer investing direct via the local exchange or are you comfortable with foreign ordinary shares (F-shares)?

Here's an example. Topicus is a $10B market cap Europe focused software acquirer spun out from Constellation Software (Canadian).

I intent to hold for decades and lump sum invest, so don't really care about transaction fees. I do care about strange price / liquidity behavior and am trying to understand how \~10% price discrepancies can occur between local and foreign shares.

See chart from yesterday comparing TOI and TOITF: [TOI CA$139.99 (▼ 0.0071%) Topicus.Com Inc | Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/TOI:CVE?comparison=TOITF%3AOTCMKTS&type=line&window=5D)

TOI traded on the Toronto Exchange has been slightly down over five days. TOITF traded over the counter in the USA has much lower volume and generally mirrors TOI, but yesterday traded a number of times at a \~10% premium.

So long as you buy when the prices align, would you care about the lower liquidity and occasional price disconnect for a long term investor?

1o6jjzw,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Tips for buying appartment in germany as a french tax resident,"Hi everyone,

I am French and I am a sailor. My wife and two children are in Berlin, and we live in an apartment that we bought six years ago.

My salary comes from France because I work for a French company, so I am a French tax resident.

We need to buy a bigger apartment because my eldest daughter can no longer stand sharing her room with her little brother. 
We would rent out our current apartment and should be able to rent it for €200 more than the monthly payment on the loan we took out for this apartment.

It is difficult for me to find a German bank that is willing to take on my case, even though my situation is stable. 
I have been working for the same company for 20 years (whose money comes from the French government), I have a permanent contract, I earn €6,000/month (our household earns around €8,500/month), my wife is german and lived in Berlin for 30 years, I personnally have lived here for 11 years.

The apartment we want to buy will cost around €550k, and we have a capital contribution of €70k.
We are having difficulty finding a bank that is willing to support our project and I understand that what bothers the banks the most is that my salary comes from France and that I do not have a German tax number.

Renting a larger apartment is not an option for us because we have already tried for a long time and have received around fifty rejections. Given the high number of applications, owners always prefer to choose applicants whose salaries come from Germany.

Two questions:

-Do you think €70k in equity capital is enough for a bank to approve our project? Obviously, the rate will be less favorable than if we had 30% of the property value in equity, but we could already pay the ""Nebenkosten"" (utility costs) or even a small percentage of the property value.

- Could you tell me what I could do to make my application more attractive to banks than it currently is? 
I thought about opening a German bank account and having my French salary paid into it, but I don't know if that would help? (I'm a little worried that if I do that, I'll end up paying taxes in Germany).
Banks often ask me for a German tax number, but as I have no income in Germany, I cannot get one.

I hope someone of you will be able to help me, thank you in advance for it!

That is close to the lowest negotiated fee I've seen, which was $0.25 per. Something closer to $.50 is what I usually see and is what I get myself from Etrade.

I wouldn't give that up, assuming you are happy with the platform and customer service you are getting.

I don't know if price improvement can match that low fee, but I doubt it. I've rarely seen people post about their price improvement that is better than a few cents per-share, even if the per-share price is over $10.

Is there a reason you are worrying about $3 to $5 of overhead? If your profit margins are so tight that $5 of overheard is the difference between net profit and net loss, you need to find trades with better profit potential. If you are high frequency trader, moving tens or hundreds of trades per day, you should move to a day trading platform that has a different fee structure, so you aren't penalized for frequency.

Past performance does not predict future returns.  That goes both ways.

I can think of a bunch of reasons why we're entering a new era of money.  We can all agree that the nature of work and earning a living is on the verge of change right?  We all wonder what shape it will take, how it will change exactly (positive and negative viewpoints either way), what the timeline for change is.  This is just one important aspect of a changing economy, we're in the midst of it and that's why it seems so confusing to so many people.

En effet.

>Verrouillage SIM : Si le téléphone est acheté en Apple Store (ou pas dans une boutique opérateur), ça sera bon ?

Oui.

>Frais de douane : c'est ma grosse question, j'imagine qu'il faut déclarer l'achat à la douane en arrivant en France mais si c'est pour payer les 20% de TVA en plus, ça perd tout son intérêt. Si mon amie ne fait pas détaxer le téléphone au Japon (donc pas d'inscription sur le passeport) et qu'elle le prend en bagage à main (de mémoire il n'y pas de portique pour sortir de Roissy) quel est le risque ? Et si jamais elle se fait ""chopper"", le plus risqué c'est qu'elle doive payer la TVA ou elle risque plus gros ?

La question est vraiment ""si je me fais chopper en pleine fraude fiscale, est-ce que je devrai juste payer ce que j'aurais dû normalement payer si je n'avais pas essayé de frauder"" ?   
La réponse est ""bien évidemment non, sinon pourquoi déclarer ?""  
 https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000039112540 

Donc oui, l'import est à déclarer en douane, et les taxes pour ce type de produit portent sur la seule TVA, c'est-à-dire 20%

NVIDIA as an example says they’ll invest billions of dollars in Open AI. Oracle commits to billions of dollars worth of NVIDIA chips and then you guessed it, OpenAI signs a hundred billion dollar deal with Oracle to store data and so on. Not to mention OpenAI doesn’t even have that type of cash. In reality, most of the money is just being passed around in a circle. It makes your reports look nicer but are you really growing your sales or just juicing each others numbers? 

Unless they’re explicitly saying in an email they’re making these deals to inflate numbers it’s not illegal for them to do this. But as you can see it clouds the reality of what’s really going on and what the demand is for their services.

High PEs and the ridiculous hype aside, I think these types of circular dealings have been less talked about but I think it will add a lot more fuel to what’s shaping up to be an already massive bubble. What are your thoughts?

njgc04h,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Jumping in here: I work at Cache, where we help investors manage concentrated stock positions tax-efficiently, so I see this situation often.

Congratulations on your retirement u/Johnny-Virgil! With nearly half your wealth in two names, your financial future still hinges on company-specific risk. A few strategies to consider:

**Exchange funds** – Contribute appreciated stock (like NVDA or AAPL) into a diversified pool without triggering capital gains. A 7-year hold, but highly effective if you don’t need liquidity soon.

**Gradual diversification** – Dollar cost average out of your stock over time while optimizing tax brackets. Reinvest proceeds in liquid ETFs or a direct indexing portfolio to maintain flexibility.

**Protective hedging** – Use collars to limit downside while retaining some upside potential. Can be used to straddle tax years if you are waiting to drop into a lower tax bracket in 2026.

**\*Tax-aware long/short** – Enhanced version of direct indexing (eg 130/30). Uses margin borrowing and short sales to accelerate loss harvesting, allows you to offset gains from selling your concentrated stocks. \*this one is a bit more aggressive and may not be appropriate for your portfolio and stage in life, but I'm including for general awareness in this thread. Please discuss with your financial advisor.

A blend of two or more of these strategies could provide immediate diversification, continued upside potential, sufficient liquidity, and tax efficiency.

I'm currently a 4th year electrical and telecommunication engineering student at the Lebanese University and I can apply for the mobility program to pursue one of the following options:

Congrats to Redditors who have successfully negotiated the latest Tweet-tantrum last Friday and again, over the weekend, and benefited from your courage and nimbleness!

A couple of interesting things stand out over POTUS’s tantrum on Friday and subsequent back-pedaling:

(1) Firstly, notice how quickly POTUS walked back on his hysterics?  Less than 48 hours after throwing a fit, he started spouting lovey-dovey words:  “It will all be fine”

“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He also said that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”

The quick-turnaround is the fastest ever, and it’s *not* a good sign.  Appears the Trump administration just realised they can’t afford to piss China now, and this can’t be good for the US, American corporates and consumers.

(2) The US-China trade war can be (over-simplified and) summarised into two key products:  US chips vs China rare earths.  Now that China has decided they do not want Nvidia’s chips and prefer to develop their own, they have come out guns blazing with their rare earth *export controls*, which are targetted at the US (on surface, the whole world is subject to these RE export controls, but China has absolute discretion, and you can bet they will be flexible with countries which are *friendly* towards China).  

RE is critical for the production of many products: consumer electronics (mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, digital cameras, computer HDD etc), EVs, rechargeable batteries, catalytic converters, defence and aerospace applications (jet engines, missile systems, radars, lasers, optical fibres), various high-tech medical equipment, industrial applications etc.  

Just imagine if Xi decided to play hardball, and ban practically all exports of processed RE materials to US and US corporates?  What’s going to happen?

The US economy is going to freeze if Xi decides to *ban* or even *go-slow* with export of RE materials to the US.

The Trump administration has recently realised they have lost leverage of the trade war to China.  Xi now hold Tronald Dump’s testicles in his hands, and has almost absolute discretion as to what he wants to do. Dump needs to be more humble now, but will he?

Am not predicting the market will collapse almost immediately, since there are still pockets of liquidity to prop up the markets / provide exit liquidity to those who prefer to lighten their positions.  Expect more volatility ahead, instead of markets continually rising in almost a straight line

1o6ee58,post,france,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Envie de changer de metier/reprendre des études (cherche un service de conseils ?),"Bonjour !

Je ne sais pas si c'est vraiment le bon endroit où il faut mettre ça - c'est mon premier post ici, désolée d'avance !

(version courte - je n’aime pas mon métier, je veux refaire des études, je cherche un endroit/service pour être accompagnée dans mes recherches je crois)

Je sais que je suis loin d'être la seule, mais je me sens très perdue dans la vie niveau boulot, et je cherche des conseils car je ne sais pas où aller. 

En ce moment je travaille comme formatrice d’anglais (je suis anglaise d’origine). J’ai fait une formation l’année dernière pour faire ce metier que j’ai bien aimé. Un an plus tard, je fais des cours particuliers dans une école de langues, et ça ne me plait pas du tout. Il n’y a pas de support, je me sens très anxieuse tout le temps (au niveau que je ne mange pas et je trouve des bleues sur mes bras parce que je me serre très fort pendant les cours), et c’est mal payé par rapport à ce que j’attendais après la formation. Je n’ai pas beaucoup de temps libre, avec le nombre d'horaires que j’ai chaque semaine je suis obligé d’utiliser mes soirs et mes weekends pour planifier les cours et je suis payée que pour les heures que j'enseigne. C’est impensable que je continue dans ce métier.

Je pense à refaire des études l’année prochaine mais c’est là où je me sens un peu bloqué. J’ai une licence que j’ai faite en Angleterre qui ne sert à rien ici (études de français et de théâtre lol), et je pense qu’un master sera le choix le plus évident, mais j’ai pensé peut-être aussi à faire un CAP ou un BTS etc. J’aimerais bien travailler dans le social ou similaire, mais j’ai beaucoup d’amies qui galèrent à trouver du travail en ce moment. J’ai joué avec l’idée de faire quelque chose de complètement différent aussi comme l’informatique, mais je ne sais pas si je suis prête à me lancer encore cinq ans dans des études. 

Ce que je veux demander je crois c’est est-ce qu’il y a un service (même payant) qui offre des conseils pour le travail/les études ? J’ai une conseillère a France Travail mais c’est difficile de prendre RDV et je sais qu’elle n’est pas vraiment là pour ça, et je suis trop vieille pour utiliser les services de mission locale etc.

Peut-être que vous avez des idées ou des conseils aussi ?

Je vous remercie d’avance ! :\^) ",sensible_footwear,0,0.5,4.0,2025-10-14 14:40:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o6ee58/envie_de_changer_de_metierreprendre_des_études/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o6ee58/envie_de_changer_de_metierreprendre_des_études/

1o6dgcv,post,france,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Questions concernant achat d'un Iphone 17 au Japon,"Bonjour à tous, une amie va bientôt se rendre au Japon et je pensais lui demander de me prendre un iPhone 17 sur place afin de profiter du prix avantageux (quasiment 200 euros de moins) mais j'avais plusieurs questions :

  
\- Les bandes réseaux : j'ai comparé entre les 2 modèles (France et Japon) et le modèle Japonais possède toutes les bandes 5G/LTE du modèle Fr et même quelques unes en plus, donc pour ça pas de problème normalement.

  
\- Le ""click"" de l'appareil photo : j'ai cru comprendre que les téléphones achetés au Japon avaient obligatoirement un ""click"" lors des prises de photo (pour éviter les photos volées), c'est pas extrêmement gênant et j'ai cru comprendre que depuis iOS 15 le bruit se désactivait en dehors du Japon.

\- Verrouillage SIM : Si le téléphone est acheté en Apple Store (ou pas dans une boutique opérateur), ça sera bon ? D'ailleurs le modèle Japonais et eSim only.

\- Frais de douane : c'est ma grosse question, j'imagine qu'il faut déclarer l'achat à la douane en arrivant en France mais si c'est pour payer les 20% de TVA en plus, ça perd tout son intérêt. Si mon amie ne fait pas détaxer le téléphone au Japon (donc pas d'inscription sur le passeport) et qu'elle le prend en bagage à main (de mémoire il n'y pas de portique pour sortir de Roissy) quel est le risque ? Et si jamais elle se fait ""chopper"", le plus risqué c'est qu'elle doive payer la TVA ou elle risque plus gros ?

  
Merci à ceux qui prendront le temps de répondre à mes questions et pour anticiper, je sais que ça s'apparente à de ""la fraude"" mais j'ai toujours été réglo dans tous mes achats et pour une fois j'aimerais un peu profiter du système.",Naan_Fromage,0,0.3,7.0,2025-10-14 13:55:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o6dgcv/questions_concernant_achat_dun_iphone_17_au_japon/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o6dgcv/questions_concernant_achat_dun_iphone_17_au_japon/

My unemployment benefits are about 60% of my net salary and my expenses are only 40%, so even on unemployment I can invest, just less.

njfesbo,comment,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Will Amazon ever pay dividends?,"Yes.  It's the opposite of what you've said here:

> Stock values and their progression is meaningless on small time scales and do not reflect the companies actual value in any way.

Long story short, it's *dividends themselves that are meaningless*, as investors already price in expectations about dividends into the stock price.  Ben Felix has [a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ) on this, with links to published (and well-accepted) academic research in the description.

That being said, dividend stocks are usually value stocks and return a historical premium over stocks that chase aggressive growth (and for which investors historically have overpaid to own).  They're perfectly fine to hold, but it doesn't make sense to chase them.",nuxenolith,4,,,2025-10-14 12:59:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/njfesbo/

There is this Grass is always greener and the self-perpetuating negativity within some people of Czechia. There are people that moved away and doubled down in their believes because Idk why and some that realised that the quality of life here is 90 percent the same you'd get in Germany.

Sorry for yet another rant about Trade Republic, but I really need help. Hopefully this post will at least convince others *not* to open an account with them.

I’m trying to completely close my Trade Republic account after selling all my assets and transferring all my cash out. But… it’s impossible.

When I click on “Close my account” in the *Help* section of the app, I just get an automated chat message saying:

>“It cannot hold any securities or have any cash balance”

Then the chat closes automatically. The thing is I have nothing left. I sold everything and transferred all the money out.

But under *Cash*, the app says I still have €1 somewhere which I can’t withdraw or even understand where it comes from.

I tried emailing support (service@traderepublic.com and service-fr@traderepublic.com) and got an automated reply:

>“We’re not able to process this request via email. Please check your request in the app.”

…which just sends me in circles back to the same screen where the app tells me I can’t close the account.

Has anyone managed to close their Trade Republic account in this situation? Any tips, explanation, support contact or some hidden procedure I might have missed? Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I was finally able to reach them by sending an email to all their adresses I could find:
treclamation@traderepublic.com

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

njf49ow,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Best Way to Invest an Emergency Fund (€40,000) for Safety and Returns in Germany/Europe?","It's a general rule everywhere as there's no guarantee you'll get some form of immediate severance or support, even if you live in Europe. 

For example, if a company goes bankrupt, there's no severance pay from the firm, at least not immediately (the courts will likely decide). Depending on where you live, social security payments could be far lower than your income. 

Other countries have much lower and shorter pay out rules, as well. 

Here in Spain, for example, you only get six months of unemployment from the state, and that's at minimum wage. Your severance from the company is between 20-33 days of pay per year worked.  

Additionally, getting fired for cause could void any company-based severance. 

Ultimately, it will really depend on your job, the social security system and employment laws where you live, plus your personal spending habits. 

3-6 months gives you a cushion plus enough peace of mind that you should be comfortable enough to start investing or putting your funds to work outside of a savings account.",abroadenco,1,,,2025-10-14 11:19:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o5iar3/best_way_to_invest_an_emergency_fund_40000_for/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o5iar3/best_way_to_invest_an_emergency_fund_40000_for/njf49ow/

A mix of a decent HYSA + short-term gov bonds sounds like the most reasonable combo in your case. You’ll keep liquidity, avoid market risk, and still earn a bit of interest while waiting for your apartment timeline.

njexlgj,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Should I use a portfolio manager or invest in my own?,"Portfolio managers, investment advisors, and similar professionals can be very useful in certain cases.

They’re helpful if you’re investing a significant amount of money but not enough to hire a full-time manager, if you tend to make impulsive decisions, or if you have specific future financial goals.

If you’re prone to panic selling or FOMO buying, then you probably need their guidance.

Investing, at its core, is simple math involving four variables — Time, Interest Rate, Monthly Contribution, and the Expected Final Amount. Usually, one of these variables is unknown. If you don’t have specific needs (like a target amount, timeframe, or particular risk tolerance-this is related to IR), you don’t need to hire anyone to manage your investments.

The best approach is to find the most tax-efficient investment this is usually a retirement account and max it out. Then, simply buy a global ETF that covers the entire market. That’s really all you need to do.",BlLB0,1,,,2025-10-14 10:08:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o65pwg/should_i_use_a_portfolio_manager_or_invest_in_my/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o65pwg/should_i_use_a_portfolio_manager_or_invest_in_my/njexlgj/

it’s economy: yes, 100% 
-The new generation is very risk tolerance, view on money is very positive, almost nobody look down on you for having money.
-The old generation, even tho they are skeptic of new ideals and it’s a bit harder to get capital from them than in the US (still a lot easier than in EU), they are generally very supportive when come to guiding the new generation. I know many of them are very willing to be mentors for the young forks.
-Government, although still quite corrupt, it is actually a lot better for business, in a sense that instead of paying tax on percentage of profit, you pay them a fix amount every year (mostly to the police, who will also give you quality protection and advice) and you are free to do whatever, the amount is heavily based on your negotiating skill, but in generally, it’s a lot cheaper than paying tax (reduce quite a bit of accounting fee too). Don’t know how long will this last, but I have business in Vietnam and in EU, it found it a lot more rewarding to make big profit in Vietnam.
-Capital, most of it is still in the hand of the older generation, who would soon be transfer directly without tax to the younger generation, mostly tight in real-estate now.

Stock wise: not sure
-Most company prefer to stay private, even the massive multi billions one prefer it that way, I think it’s good and bad, when you stay private, you can hide your questionable practice from the public to make more profit. The one that are listed to the public tense to have a CEO who get paid a fix salary, a lot less incentive to bring back massive profit, comparing to a CEO who is a head of a family org, and every cent is in his control.
-Government is still comprise of a class of old, highly political and have generally low business acumen, get your business public means they will have eyes on you and will start asking for payout. Big businesses still have sponsors, but they are a group of limited, hand pick and know very little about the operation of the business itself, they get a big pay check but their financial situation will be tied to the company’s performance for they act more like an employee than a police or a tax man.
-Assets, like land and house, will most likely will still rise, but foreigners the access is still limited.
-To invest in Vietnam for the short-terms, you can make it big if you have tons of money (300k+) and have a partner who like you enough to let you dip your toes in their business.

njet82l,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How do I maximize return on my emergency fund?,"IMO emergency fund can be thought of in stages. This is how you can account for risk and allocate accordingly. An example could be you have six months of expenses sitting in cash. Then you have another six months in more conservative investments. You make the choice depending on the likely hood of needing to blow through all the cash and into the next allocation. 

I realize this is not how people typically think of ""emergency fund"". I think more in terms of successes levels or parachutes. This more closely fits the first level in my thinking which is cash on hand for unexpected expenses. Other levels are for conservative growth.

1o67zjb,post,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Will Vietnam be the next China?,"I think Lee Kuan Yew is right in thinking that Vietnam will be the next Asian tiger. It's developing at a good pace despite being set back by decades of war. It has young demographics and a hard-working and intelligent population that put a lot of value on education. It's also right next to China and the US-China trade wars put it in a great position to benefit from manufacturing shifts. The government, though corrupt, is trying to open the country up to foreign capital and FTSE Russell very recently upgraded Vietnam to secondary emerging market status.

Furthermore, Vietnamese people are very fearful of their own stock market. They would much rather buy land, gold, or even international stocks rather than invest into their own stocks. Even then, the people that do invest in domestic stocks are more often than not only in it for short-term speculation and thrills–the same demographic that are heavily into sports betting and poker. Relatively few invest in it for the long term, in part because of scandals involving insider trading and creative accounting.

I feel that as the country develops a bit and starts to crack down on corruption more, and as Vietnamese people through improved education, media influence, etc. warm to and become less fearful of their country's stock market there will be a massive bull run on stocks like with China in the 2000s.

I’m in Hungary, planning to buy my first apartment in about **2–2.5 years**. Right now I’ve got about **€15,000 worth of HUF** just sitting in my bank account doing absolutely nothing + I save around **€750 per month** on top of that.

Since all this will go into a **down payment**, I don’t want to gamble it, but I’d love to **earn something** instead of losing value to inflation.

Any suggestions for a **short-to-medium-term, low-risk** strategy in this situation?

I’ve been thinking about:

**- ETFs:** but that is taxed here if withdrawn in 2 years  
**- short-term government bond:** the only one available under 2 years is an Euribor based one ending in 2026.09  
\- **bank-offered investment funds (like open-end mutual funds)**, or even **“high-yield” savings accounts** (Hungarian banks often advertise such funds as “safe investments,” but I’m not sure if they really are)  
\- or maybe something like **Revolut’s savings vaults**, but not sure what makes sense from Hungary/EU perspective.

nje92jb,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Will Amazon ever pay dividends?,"I understand perfectly. I don’t think *you* understand what it is that I’m saying.

A share of stock entitles you to a proportional share of a companies profit. A dividend *is* that profit. The company can either can retain it and reinvest it back into the business or they can pay it back to you. The only question is who is going to put *your* dollar to better use, the company or you. If there isn’t a viable opportunity for the company to turn *your money* into more money then it’s better to give *your money* back to you. Otherwise it’s literally just sitting there, getting eaten away by inflation and costing you opportunities to deploy it efficiently.

I understand that by distributing a dividend the share price will go down proportionally. But that’s not the same as “selling your shares” because selling your shares literally means you have less of an ownership stake in the company and therefore less claim to its future earnings. Receiving a dividend doesn’t change your claim to future earnings. That’s why the comparison doesn’t make much sense to me.",YuckyBurps,7,,,2025-10-14 06:15:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/nje92jb/

I live in British Columbia Canada, and our household makes about 250K/yr. We have picked a platform to invest on and have an idea of what kind of portfolio diversity would fit our goals, but I’m considering using a portfolio manager instead. 

If I do it myself how often will I need to be moving my money and looking for opportunities? I want to invest for long term gain, so I don’t plan on moving investments around much, but it has got me thinking. 

Does anyone have personal advice on what has worked for them? Who recommends doing it yourself and seeking advice-only services, and who recommends using a portfolio manager?

1o65niu,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.

Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.

Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.

They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?

Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.

But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.

So the real question is this:
Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?
Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",TigerMCU,0,0.13,12.0,2025-10-14 06:09:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/

The chairman of hive technologies is Frank Holmes and he has a very solid track record.
If you guys are still doubting bitcoin, just keep in mind that this digital currency is keeping 3rd world countries still a float and the demmand for it is absolutely crucial.
Also they are currently or the first company to be profitable then any of its competitors...
Analyst are giving it a price target of $10, soon to change in my opinion (will likely be higher when they secure 25EH)
(Bonus: the company is very transparent and updates regularly on their progress/expansion)
Another point is when they mine bitcoin, they won't sell it like the rest of the competion they are true believer of bitcoin and they hold the majority of what they mine.





More catylst short term


Earnings in november,


News of reaching 25EH before Thanksgiving


Potential more deals with their ai/hpc

Bitcoin momentum going possibly to 140k-180k by the eoy from analyst (if bitcoin goes to that price, hive technologies can easly go 20+)

Fun fact: any energy that's not being used for they're data center, they redistribute that energy into nearby neighborhoods (schools, homes) providing them with heat/air conditioning, might not be a big deal in North America but in the south goes a long way...


In my opinion this stock is underrated and undervalued. I love their management, good financials, growing very fast, and very high potential. (Do your own research)!

I kinda have a stupid theory that there may not be a nuclear market crash like many people have hoped anytime soon and anticipated despite the charts and datas say otherwise

Like there’s too much personal interest from within the Trump admisnistration and economy that they won’t let the market crash anytime soon unless he wanted too.

They will keep throwing bandages to anything that point out the weakness just to keep this alive or make any sudden change in policy that is unpredictable/ unprecedented to keep it going.

njdzd6a,comment,wallstreetbets,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,"Just yolo'd 80 calls in ALIT LEAPs, a stealth AI play at $3/share","They have their own AI engine called LumenAI built right into their WorkLife platform. They do partner with OpenAI, in the same way others like Microsoft use it, as it makes no sense for them to create their own LLM when they can simply plug one into their own platform. 

Given the amount of data that client companies provide to Alight from HR, health, wealth management, and  Alight's own sales data, the ability to optimize and manage with AI tools is a huge margin booster. The company has 9,400 employees or so, and can continue to remain asset light as they pursue higher gross margins. 

The financials are actually fairly good. 

-$2.3B annual revenue on a $1.6B market cap

-growing Free Cash Flow, with the dividend well covered at 30% of FCF

-paying down debt aggressively, cutting it's debt down from $4B to $2B in just 3 years

-have never diluted investors, and have plenty of cash to sustain operations, they've bought back 36 million shares (about 7% of shares outstanding) and still have a fairly aggressive $281M share repurchase authorization. 

Of the $1B loss for Q2, $982B was the one time impairment for the Health write down. So going forward, the company will have that off the books, as analysts have even acknowledged the balance sheet is much more cleaned up now. In 2026 they'll reduce their $600M TRA by $200M or so, which is the tax receivable agreement from the spac that will eventually be fully rolled off the balance sheet at this point. 

To summarize, Alight is responsible with its cash, its paid down it's debt, and on a DCF model calculation it's worth around $8-11/share. This company is doing all of the things I want to see a company do to properly protect its balance sheet.",Dismal-Conference-76,1,,,2025-10-14 05:06:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5ri13/just_yolod_80_calls_in_alit_leaps_a_stealth_ai/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5ri13/just_yolod_80_calls_in_alit_leaps_a_stealth_ai/njdzd6a/

njdx0oj,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Do you hedge tail risk on iron condors?,"I sell 0DTE NDX ICs with 100 point spread for about a dollar.

Last Friday, my ICs were ITM incurring a potential loss of 10K per put spread.

I managed to recover without the use of hedging.

I wrote about it in

[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1l28vfd/0dte\_with\_ndx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1l28vfd/0dte_with_ndx/)

(I also wrote about how I made adjustments to turn a 10K loss into a small gain or loss in 2 other occasions.)

I’ll copy it here:

**October 10, 2025 (Friday) NDX down 877 - Potential Max Loss** 

NDX at open = 25116.

9 am CT: STO 24740 for 1.05

10:30 am: NDX= 24550, PS is ITM. Potential max loss of 100.

11 am: Roll even to Monday Oct 13 24740 for -9.00

11:45 am, STO Oct 10 24140 for 1.50

1 pm, STO STO Oct 10 24190 for 2.00.

The 24190 was threatened near the close. I was ready to BTC it for a small loss.

3 pm: NDX close = 24221. The 24740 put is 519 ITM. The 24140 and 24190 expired OTM.

Net loss = -4.45.

**October 13, 2025 (Monday)**

NDX at open = 24628.

Looking for a possible roll to next day (Tuesday)  or Friday.

12:16 pm: NDX = 24730. STO Oct 13 24550 PS for 3.20.

12:47 pm: NDX = 24720. STO Oct 13 24500 PS for 1.90.

After 2 pm: NDX oscillates between 24700 and 24770. The 24740 hovers from ITM to OTM.

The premium for the 24740 put is very high because the time value is very high. This will not result in a good roll to the next day. 

I decided not to roll. If it expires ITM, then I will STO the next day’s PS after the market closes.

NDX close = 24750. The 24740 PS expires OTM.

Net gain for 2 days = 0.65 vs. a potential max loss of 100.",papakong88,1,,,2025-10-14 04:51:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5oqwp/do_you_hedge_tail_risk_on_iron_condors/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5oqwp/do_you_hedge_tail_risk_on_iron_condors/njdx0oj/

njduukh,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,">What the market is banking on is AGI, not LLMs that learn patterns. I work in tech and I can tell it’s smoke screens.

Huh? The market is not banking on AGI. AGI is the eventual holy grail obviously, but the immediate term investments are all going into agentic AI solutions and tooling. You work in tech but you're unaware of Cursor, Cline, Roo, and others? Most companies I know of or have friends that actually work there (Capital One, Bain Capital, Klarna, Experian, Amazon, Booz Allen, McDonalds, Walmart, etc.) all have agentic solutions already in place and make it a point that every developer/manager/product/marketing person gets a license to their implemented tooling (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, Cline, Roo, CoPilot, etc.). Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, and CoPilot all have agentic modalities that allow you automate things like bug fixes, MR/PR's, pipelines, testing, etc. etc. Hell we have contracts that mandate AI/LLM usage to speed up productivity, it's already being built into client agreements. These and many other companies all have contracts with various AI companies, Glean AI being another one I mentioned that's already implemented at private equity and finance firms.

>When it will be useful is when it surfaces among the graves of all the ai startups.

It's already useful, you're just not paying attention or misinformed. There are numerous companies that have implemented it or sell services and have seen large profit/revenue growth.

Azure & other cloud services grew **39% YoY**, and Azure **surpassed $75B** annual revenue. They had the largest quarter of Copilot adds since launch and a 100k-seat Copilot rollout at Barclays. **Verizon** rolled out a Gemini-based assistant to 28,000 support reps and average chat time fell and sales through service reps climbed about **40%** after the full rollout. **United Airlines** already uses voice and chat flows that now automate roughly **31%** of flight-cancellation requests and **64%** of wheelchair requests. **Duolingo** saw a record +41% YOY revenue growth along with record profitability due heavily in part to their AI Max subscription platform along with falling costs in their AI tooling. Mind you, there are others, like Palantir that I won't even touch because we all know about them

1o63dnv,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Tata Electronics acquires Chinese iPhone supplier Justech’s India unit for about $100 million, sources say","Tata Electronics has acquired Chinese industrial firm Justech Precision’s India unit for close to $100 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, as the Tata Group subsidiary bolsters its manufacturing capacity to benefit from Apple’s focus on iPhone manufacturing in India.

The transaction was concluded in August, with HSBC Bank and HDFC Bank advising on the deal, according to the people close to the deal.

Headquartered in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, China, Justech Precision has been a supplier to Apple since 2008. It provides industrial equipment, such as computer numerical control machines used for precise cutting and fabrication tasks, to Foxconn, the world’s largest assembler of Apple products.

Justech Precision Industry India, incorporated in late 2019 and based in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comments, neither did Tata Group. Tata Electronics declined to comment.

In January, Tata Electronics reportedly bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron’s India operation that operates an iPhone plant, Reuters reported. The deal’s value was not disclosed.

The acquisitions come as Tata Electronics, which began assembling iPhones in India in 2023, seeks to expand its manufacturing capacity as Apple reportedly plans to source all of the iPhones for the U.S. market from India by the end of 2026.

Apple, which still manufacturers most of its smartphones in China, has been taking urgent steps to build capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn, pivoting away from China amid higher tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Foxconn still accounts for two-thirds of India’s total iPhones shipments, with Tata making the remaining one-third, according to Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, who expects that market share could change soon as Tata scales up its manufacturing.

Tata currently operates two plants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which was formerly owned by Wistron.

# Made in India by 2026

Apple started looking for manufacturing alternatives after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown in China disrupted output at its largest assembly plant. The heightened Beijing-Washington tensions and tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the U.S. this year have prompted Apple to accelerate the shift in production.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially slapped prohibitive triple-digit tariffs on imports from China before granting a temporary reprieve for smartphones shipments. Despite India also facing high tariffs from the U.S., iPhones made in India don’t attract any duties as of now. Apple’s shift in production to India instead of the U.S. has angered Trump, who in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years worked to promote India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high-tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development.

But Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengaluru assembling older model iPhones, which saw a labor riot in late 2020.

Apple is looking to build “highly localized” partners to become “truly diversified,” instead of bringing Chinese or Taiwanese partners in India and be dependent on them, Shah said, but finding alternatives for components sourced primarily from Chinese suppliers could take years.

“It will not be a sprint to build like-for-like supplier ecosystem as it enjoyed in China, but a marathon and a step by step process,” Shah added.

India will account for around 26% of global iPhone shipments by the end of 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year, according to the latest estimate by Counterpoint.

Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Justech’s innovation exhibition center in Jiangsu during his trip to China in March where he pledged to continue to make large-scale investment in the country.

Of course, prior to 2022, buybacks were certainly better since investors had more flexibility in the recognition of capital gains and that came with no downside.

But the parent comment is still correct. Buybacks + dividends are roughly equivalent (with minor tax tradeoffs), however a buyback/dividend vs a company just holding onto excess cash is not the same.

If that were true KO after 100 years of dividend payments would be worthier nearly notiing.  But in reality it worth vastly more than it was 100 years ago.  Selling shares and stock splits are permanent. once it happens it is not going back to what it was.  After a dividend is payed there is a very small share price drop but it doesn't last long as new profits refill the company back account and the value of the company recovers from the payout.

When people bool money together to build an apartment complex they expect to get money back from their investment.  And they do.  They get  a portion of the apartment complex profit.  Each investor in the apartment complex is a shareholder, and their profit sharing checks are the dividend. Or they can sell there share of the business to someone else and that person then gets the profit sharing check from the apartment complex.

That gain is the market pricing in the hype and the IV run-up ahead of earnings. Once the report drops, IV collapses or what you will see referred often as IV crush. Even if the company beats, your option can still lose value because volatility resets to normal and theta finishes the job.

If you’re holding a 10/31 expiry, you’re sitting right on the knife edge: one day of wrong move and that 250% gain can vanish fast. The clean move now is to take the win, or sell most and let a small runner ride through earnings if you want some action.

As for timing in general, you did really well in buying options before the crowd and selling them into the event. It's a popular strategy to be long vol before earnings (see Euan Sinclair) but it can be hard to do at scale.

1o61viy,post,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Built a Regime-Based Overnight Mean Reversion Model - 10.13.25, 3M Results: 40.4% returns, 65.4% WR, Sharpe Ratio 3.91","Over the past few months, I’ve developed a mean reversion strategy that trades based on leveraged ETFs/funds, buying right before market close and selling at the next day’s open. It's based on categorizing the SP500 into one of 5 market regimes based on overall market conditions and then trading specific stocks depending on statistically significant Bayesian probabilities of overnight reversals from 10 years of backtested data.  

I have been running it live for about 3 months, and want to provide my results to the reddit community. From 7/14/25 to 10/10/25, my results were:

* 40.4% returns
* 65.4% WR over 81 trades
* Sharpe ratio of 3.91
* Low correlation to the SP500: 0.138

In the interests of transparency, I have posted about this strategy before, and want to provide historical results so you can compare these results against existing ones. I have attached a table where I will be tracking my 3-month rolling performance, each week. 

My previous posts a full list of my trades from 7/14/25-10/3/25. I have included the new trades that have occurred in the past week. Please feel free to look at my previous posts for the backlog of all my trades. 

The concept:

Stocks often overreact during normal trading hours and then partially correct overnight. By identifying stocks that follow this pattern with statistically significant consistency, you can exploit predictable overnight reversions.

However, not every stock behaves the same way, the degree and consistency of these reversions depend on both the magnitude of the intraday price change and the broader market regime. Large intraday moves tend to create stronger and more reliable reversions, especially when aligned with the prevailing market trend.

So, I built a system that classifies each trading day over the past 10 years into one of 5 market regimes (strong bull, weak bull, bear, sideways, and unpredictable) based on market sentiment indicators like momentum indicators (SP500 moving averages) and volatility (VIX and others). 

I then collected some of the most volatile stocks I could find, ie, the ones that experience the largest intraday price changes and subsequent overnight reversions. The type of stock that seemed to move the most each day, and then predictably return to the mean, were leveraged ETFs and funds. So, I looked at companies like Direxion, ProShares, and others, and compiled a list of all their leveraged funds and ETFs.

Then, I analyzed how each stock behaves overnight following an overreaction in each market regime. When a stock’s historical data shows a statistically significant tendency to move in a specific direction overnight, I buy that stock at 3:50 pm EST and sell it at market open the following day.

Live Results:

Despite trading leveraged ETFs and volatile setups, drawdowns stayed relatively contained and correlation to the SP500 was relatively low. This means the system is generating alpha, independent of the trends of the SP500. 

In the equity curve image, the blue line is my strategy, the orange is SPY over the same 3-month trading period. You can see how quickly the curve compounds despite occasional dips. These results are consistent with a probabilistic reversion model, rather than a trend-following system.

Key insights from this process:

The market regime classification system makes a huge difference. Some patterns vanish or reverse depending on the market regime, with certain stocks reverting in highly predictable patterns in some regimes and exhibiting no statistically significant patterns in others. 

Even with my 60-65% accuracy, because the expectancy per trade is positive, and I am able to trade most days, the overall value of the strategy compounds quickly, with my relatively small loss. 

This strategy is all about finding statistically significant patterns in the noise, validated against 10 years of back test data, filtered through multiple statistical analysis tools.

Not financial advice, but I wanted to share progress on a probabilistic day trading strategy I’ve been working on, which is starting to show real promise. 

I’m more than happy to discuss methodology, regime classification logic or the stats behind the filtering. 

Thank you!",ChristianZahl,43,0.89,10.0,2025-10-14 03:05:52,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o61viy,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o61viy/built_a_regimebased_overnight_mean_reversion/
1o61qvi,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"The more I learnt, the worse I became","I started my option journey by selling far OTM puts. I did this on QQQ (1DTE at 3% OTM) and MSTR (25% OTM with a cheap long for margin protection). I did great with these two trades. I also bought calls when index pulled back and these did much better. 

Then I started learning. Learnt about tail risk, hedging, sizing & risk management, volatility expansion, margin call risks, trading volatility rather than direction etc. All good stuff to learn. I started sizing low, understanding position sizing (max risk of 2% per position), hedging with longs or calendarizing my trades, trading more market neutral trades like BWBs, trading VRP based on quant alerts etc. 

I checked my performance recently and noticed that I'm at loss or break even while my earlier trades were highly profitable and did so well. lol. I am also sizing them low which isn't giving great dollar profit as well.

You could then sell roughly $65k without capital gains annually (with the actual sale of stock being more depending on your basis and how much of your holdings is gains). Then you could DCA that into a more diversified portfolio, VOO with some core bond fund with whatever split you’re comfortable with. 

Yes, you’ll carry some non diversification risk and added volatility, but neither Apple nor Nvidia are going anywhere and they’ve already returned very well for you.

njd3ca1,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,You can continue to invest in the market or put the money into a savings account with 7% annual yield. What do you do?,"Yes that would be worthwhile. It's a very specific scenario where they can average returns across decades because there's essentially guaranteed inflow from new contributions that could be used to prop up a period where the investments don't keep up. I'm, sure you have to be a union member to get a job and union members have to contribute so it's the kind of thing that can only be done by a large organization.

On average that would be like 4.5% real return. The high inflation we've had the last few years would suck for someone in that program that's retired.

Over a long enough time frame equities would probably do a little better, but you'd also have a significant fixed income portion during your draw down phase to avoid sorr risk that wouldn't be necessary with a guaranteed return. Essentially you could retire with less because you could rely on the return.

Instead of comparing it to the market I'd compare if to an annuity or pension. Without looking into it further I'd guess the main drawback would be no inflation or col adjustments so you still want a decent margin over what you need to cover expenses, but it's a good option if it's available to you.",siamonsez,1,,,2025-10-14 01:55:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5y6si/you_can_continue_to_invest_in_the_market_or_put/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5y6si/you_can_continue_to_invest_in_the_market_or_put/njd3ca1/

Compounding is on our side, and depending on the vehicle, meaningful capital and dividend growth can still be achieved without chasing the highs of the NASDAQ-100 for the next 40 years before thinking about how you're going to get paid without losing your net worth in old age via selling.

Secondly you say you want to control your possible downside, but a covered call has a theoretical unlimited downside.

Secon check what you did, if you did an open buy, you'll have to do an close sell to close the position. If you did indeed do a covered call, you did an open sell, and you'll have to do a close buy to close the position. Make sure you select the right strike prices and experiration too.

1o5ysn0,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Options Gain - Sell Now or Wait,"Hey, 

So one of my options (a call) I bought as an earnings play has increased 255.84% since I bought it, or $197. I'm still relatively new to options, so looking for input and knowledge here. Should I sell this option now, or wait until after earnings because it will be worth even more to sell after, assuming a good earnings report? When I bought it, it was moderately out of the money, and it is now in the money. Earnings Report date is 10/30 before market open. I know Theta decay is a thing, but don't know enough to know how much or badly that would impact the value, and if the value could still gain after accounting for the theta decay if the earnings report is really good? Expiration on the option is 10/31. Current Greeks are .5422 delta, .0526 gamma, -.0845 theta, .0179 Vega, .0041 rho. IV is 167.29%, volume is 2446, open interest is 4650. Seems like there was a good-news deal announced in the last day or so that may have boosted the underlying stock and this option as well. 

Also, generally, how far out should you be selling calls after you have bought them to minimize theta decay? For monthlies, weeklies, 0dte, longer than that? Is there some formula to use?

Any and all input and knowledge would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!",Cryptic_Ethereal_79,0,0.5,12.0,2025-10-14 00:47:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5ysn0/options_gain_sell_now_or_wait/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5ysn0/options_gain_sell_now_or_wait/

njcia8z,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Which strategy do you like better?,"He’s right technically. It’s just that makes a very big assumption. Which is the market will keep going up. While that is true most of the time we have run into times when a very large crash, or a large crash followed shortly by another crash caused the markets to take a very long time to recover. In 1929 it took until 1944 for the markets to get back to even. In 2000 it took until 2013 to get back to even. So if we are in another period like that either right before, right at, or shortly after you retire the risk of running out of money is very real. Run a Monte Carlo simulation on using the buy and hold strategy versus owning dividend stocks and funds.  At that time if you were 65 and retired holding the S&P 500, withdrawing 4% a year you would have $72k left of $100k in principal to start. If holding a dividend portfolio paying say 3% you would have $94k left using the same withdrawal rate. Now that COULD or could not happen. It’s a total crapshoot shoot, but personally I like the mental aspect of having cash coming in every month or week without worrying. Just like having a paid off mortgage. It may not be what everyone would do, but I can’t stand having debt.

Edit: the other game changer in my opinion that many people overlook is the availability of high yield funds. The sheer amount of choices available today vs even 10 years ago is staggering. You can easily build yourself a diversified portfolio of stocks, and ETFs that will be all weather, and yield 8% plus. It’s really not that difficult. 10 years ago that would have been very difficult.",PomegranatePlus6526,1,,,2025-10-13 23:53:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o42ajc/which_strategy_do_you_like_better/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o42ajc/which_strategy_do_you_like_better/njcia8z/

If the basis of your profit making is built on delusion, when the ground shifts from under you and you have to deal with crashing down.. it doesn't make the fall less real just because you started at a high point. In other words: if you spend your days getting continually fucked up in a drug-fueled psychosis, if your supply gets cut off, then you're going to have to deal with the reality/consequences of the withdrawal. And the deeper you're in that addiction, the harder it's going to be.

Second, what we're dealing with right now isn't simply the act of massive profit taking and then all of the sudden the profit making stops. We're beginning with massive losses. The underpinning issues is, actually, the fundamentals and investments being ploughed into AI is because there is no real profit being made in that sector -- as is the case for much of tech. Like, Microsoft and Oracle are okay, but xAi isn't turning profits. OpenAI is just an open blackhole of money. Anthropic doesn't make any money. All of the investment in data centers, in model research and implementation, etc., None of these investments are based on profitability. They're based in extremely risky bets on who can consolidate the AI space before it implodes entirely.

Where the profit is at is in chip manufacturing and data hosting. But that infrastructure and production will stop if there's no way to actually substantially improve or integrate the underlying reason for all of that manufacturing or data hosting. You're just getting an extremely rapid overaccumulation of capital.

This is the problem that Deutsche pointed out in their report. And they noted that all of this irrational investment and valuation is the only reason we're not, on paper, in a massive recession yet. There are several extremely likely choke points that could make this entire thing crumble. One is, simply, the drive for AI services vanishes and no one wants to participate while the big AI companies get their shit together as the models start to plateau on performance. Another just happened last week: China basically cuts off the lifeblood of resources needed to continue manufacturing at this rate. Another is energy prices just get so out of hand that it's simply not profitable to maintain these AI data centers, which OPEC can make happen in an instant; and partially is why you got Microsoft out there now trying leasing old nuclear plants, which itself threatens any sort of profitability (xAI is being run off of fucking generators, lmao.)

So, right now, we're locked in this sinkhole where profits and profitmaking simply doesn't matter. The quicksand in which all of this built are now and forever will be entirely unprofitable. On top of that is the infrastructure and manufacturing, which are somewhat profitable for now, that are being consumed in a mix of political instability and their own drive to achieve resources just to keep things alive, which will eat into profitability.

None of these things are sound investments. It's all entirely irrational.",Secure_Marzipan_5017,2,,,2025-10-13 23:45:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5ka0v/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_oct_13_2025/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5ka0v/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_oct_13_2025/njcguiu/
njcgsw7,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,This is definitely a possibility unfortunately. But it’s probably the easiest way to keep partial positions in NVDA and AAPL while having some sort of safety net. You could also simultaneously set up alerts on your phone in the event the stock drops x%. If your stop loss is below that then you’d at least be alerted and if it’s a vertical drop you could try and sell or cancel your stop loss order. Unfortunately hard to automate that and would have to be manually done.,pupulewailua,2,,,2025-10-13 23:45:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njcgsw7/

njccqwf,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Will Amazon ever pay dividends?,"Amazon probably won’t pay a dividend anytime soon. Their entire model is still built on reinvesting free cash flow into AWS expansion, AI infrastructure (Trainium/Inferentia chips), and logistics automation. Historically, management’s view has been simple — as long as internal ROI > cost of capital, there’s no reason to distribute cash.

Right now, Amazon’s shareholder yield mainly comes from buybacks. Once AWS growth slows and CapEx stabilizes, they could pivot like Meta and Google did after their own AI build-outs peaked — but that’s likely a few years out.

If you’re curious about how different models (including AI tools) evaluate long-term capital efficiency and dividend potential, there’s a solid write-up called “Best AI Stock Picking Tools in 2025” on Medium by MarketCrunch AI — you can find it easily by searching that title on Google or Medium (I’m avoiding direct links since Reddit auto-filters them).",Initial_Audience_321,4,,,2025-10-13 23:23:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/njccqwf/
1o5wo4g,post,StockMarket,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,'Very troubling': AI's self-investment spree sets off bubble alarms on Wall Street,"The companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom are investing billions of dollars in each other — and analysts say that the increasing entanglement is adding to risk of an AI bubble.

Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) in late September said it would [invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html) ([OPAI.PVT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OPAI.PVT)) as part of a partnership for the ChatGPT maker to use Nvidia’s chips to train and run its next generation of models.

This is just one of a flurry of deals among a tight web of Big Tech players that have been made public in the last few months. There's also Nvidia's [$6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave](https://www.reuters.com/business/coreweave-nvidia-sign-63-billion-cloud-computing-capacity-order-2025-09-15/) ([CRWV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWV)), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's [Nvidia's reported $2 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-07/musk-s-xai-nears-20-billion-capital-raise-tied-to-nvidia-chips) investment linked to its customer xAI ([XAAI.PVT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XAAI.PVT)). And then there's OpenAI's own deals with [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi0N-tG2YIkk9TfG4XlqyZMi5QQy4hAXzuYdDYVDhpdx23tAy81vM-Ic-cJizQ%3D&gaa_ts=68e9026a&gaa_sig=3AEj7IfJ4oTZWVP_B6xSI5xye0waShpyKoNR_a3osU_cO8OHb5QbGpwL8XWub6kVfaxJVaMYKJsuEOuvfrx7UQ%3D%3D) ([ORCL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORCL)), [CoreWeave](https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Announces-Agreement-with-OpenAI-to-Deliver-AI-Infrastructure/default.aspx) ([CRWV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWV)), and chipmaker [Advanced Micro Devices](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-stock-rockets-higher-on-multibillion-dollar-openai-deal-125503782.html) ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)).

Wall Street analysts say the agreements highlight a growing trend: AI infrastructure providers, led by Nvidia, are investing in their customers, who then turn around and buy more of the infrastructure providers’ products. In other cases, customers of infrastructure like OpenAI are investing in their suppliers.

Since I was feeling confident about RR, wanted to start with options, and also wanted to control possible downside, I opted for a covered call with my 100 shares of RR. Market buy first thing today.

However, I see it go down 20% almost instantly, then check RH's simulator, and it only shows me losing more $ as the price slider approaches my strike price. When I checked about selling it, RH gave me an alert that I don't have enough shares as collateral, when I do have exactly 100 shares to cover my single contract, or so I thought.

I was looking at some other ones as well.

Bought some BXSL, OBDC, HTGC last Friday for high yields but then changed my mind after looking at their financials and sold them all today. Mainly because I don't understand these businesses.

I noticed shrinking or negative net income, or negative operating cash flows (maybe this is common for BDCs? I didn't bother to look at the actual line items). People said rate cuts will hurt these as well, due to floating rate structure (this part makes sense).

Soooooooo

Would you say MAIN and ARCC are the best of the BDCs? 

Reddit says they survived big crashes and outperformed the S&P so I'm very comfortable owning these two altho they trade at a premium and got low yields. If they dip, I can DCA. 

Are there any other BDCs that are good value tho",Heineken_500ml,34,0.89,36.0,2025-10-13 22:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o5vnyh/any_good_bdcs_other_than_main_and_arcc/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o5vnyh/any_good_bdcs_other_than_main_and_arcc/

However, as we've seen with Snowflake and other software platforms like Unity, if you have a niche and are good at it, can manage the operation well, and are asset light, then you can actually leverage AI to make your Software or CRM solutions superior. Speaking with multiple management employees at various corporations, none of them have even begun to replace their CRM or HR vendors with in house solutions because the costs dont justify bringing it in house, and the efficiency gained with these vendors is quite good.

For comparison, Alight's much larger competitor which has more offerings is SAP, with a market cap of $332 Billion versus Alight at $1.6 Billion. I've noticed that Alight has several up and coming companies that use their services, so if any of those companies achieve unicorn status, thats major revenue and earnings growth for Alight as well.

1o5swmc,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,My wife took me back after I doubled our life’s savings in 6 months,"Long story short, these last 6 months have been nothing short of a seatbeltless rollercoaster ride through the ground floor of the MGM Grand. 

In the middle of April I watched a video on YouTube about how AI was going to destroy humanity after growing to unimaginable scales etc. This was when I first learned about AI and the ChatGPT app, and I truly thought that AI was going to change the investing world. Hell bent on getting into the markets before anyone else saw the same video on YouTube, I immediately took our life’s savings, enabled margin and threw everything at what ChatGPT told me were the big AI plays. 

Fast forward 6 months. 

This morning, I found myself screenshotting my gains and sending it to one my buddies. Then, I remembered what another fellow regard on this sub once said. “If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell” or something. At market open, I sold all of my positions at a staggering 126% gain. My wife is absolutely thrilled with my genius fiscal performance, so much so that I’M her new boyfriend now. 

In all seriousness, I feel like I’ve won a small lottery and I’d like to finally cash in on my “congrats and fuck yous”. This is more than a years salary for us and is going to help us in more ways that we could have imagined. 

Good luck out there boys- I’ll be watching you from the sidelines!

The problem starting new is assigning a value to the company in the first place so you can know whether you think it's cheap or expensive.

njbixpq,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Oct 13, 2025","It might not matter to you personally, but mass delusion in the market does actually matter. For one, seeing it completely untethered from reality is a signal that it is detached from larger fundamentals affecting the real economy. It means that the finance system, and the financial class, are ignoring on-the-ground issues, are engaging in fraud, etc. The longer it goes on, the more painful it will be to recover from for most people, including the vast majority of people who have spent the last 3 or 4 years here bragging about their gains.

One crisis is not like the other, but they all have a single thread: when irrational exuberance takes place and when it comes time to pay the price, everyone else but the rich will be completely screwed. Those ""few hundred bucks"" you have may turn into a few thousand here in about year, if the illusion can manage to keep going on that long. But that thousand, if you don't immediately see it vanish, will be rendered meaningless. You'll immediately need it for an emergency and you will burn through it, maybe even faster if the stagflation remains durable.

You know the cliche ""The higher you climb, the farther you fall""? That's what this is. That's why people are ""freaking out."" The higher we climb in a market with an economy that could fall out at any given moment (either on Trump's whims, or the inability of people to pay for necessities and have to start deciding between food or shelter, etc.), the more painful it will be to recover. Right now the economy is only being floated with AI investments. Were it not for that, we'd be in an extremely different situation.

My mistake last year and going into Trump's presidency is that I thought there would still be some logic or sense built into the system. But that doesn't seem to be the case. A house of cards will always fall, though, and I'm done making arguments based on questions of ""when"" it will happen because, at this point, it doesn't really matter when it happens. We're at a point where when it does happen, it will be devastating. Whatever containment strategy that could've been prepped before hand, is no longer available.

You think you're winning by making your hundreds, potentially thousands, right now in an irrational market but the top 1% will immediately shut and seal the exit doors for you when things do go awry and the building starts to burn down. That's where we're at right now.

If you think it won't or you think you can do better elsewhere cut your losses and move the capital to the other investment. This goes double for taxable accounts as the loss can offset gains and reduce your tax burden.

If you don't feel comfortable making those kinds of decisions you probably shouldn't be investing in single stocks and just go do the boglehead approach. Nothing wrong with that. It's a time tested approach that works well. No guarantee though.

My big concern when I come across these kinds of stories is that you are lacking the skills and experience to make these decisions, just like I know next to nothing about being an auto mechanic, a successful plumber, a great electrician, or an artist. I know enough about those things to do very minor things and beyond that I stop and get there person with experience and skill to do the task. Think about that. You have some skills at something and you should probably put time into those.

njbfgym,comment,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"You sure can! 

The first consultation is typically a meet-and-greet setting, where you can share your situation and goals - then the CFP can share his/her approach to working with clients, disclose their fees, describe next steps (if you're interested in continuing). 

In most cases, a CFP likely won't charge you for a single consultation like you're describing. That's because you'll need to actually _hire_ the CFP as your advisor before getting specific, detailed recommendations (and the CFP will tell you that, too). 

Once you receive actionable financial _advice_ from a CFP, that's where the rubber meets the road. Otherwise, you'll likely have a good discussion that results in some broad thoughts/direction for your situation, but nothing specifically _actionable_ without a professional advisor. 

Plenty of meetings end with no firm commitment and general takeaways like: ""You should consult an estate attorney, and I can recommend one if you'd like,"" or ""seems like you need time to _ABC_ and might want to consider _XYZ_ before you're ready to hire an advisor,"" etc. 

You'll be in good hands with a CFP, whether it's for one brief consultation or beyond. Good luck my friend! 

(Happy to continue answering questions, although please note I am _NOT_ a Certified Financial Planner and cannot provide financial advice)

EDIT: forgot to mention that you can also engage a CFP strictly for a financial plan at a fixed rate. Example: plan to reduce my cap gain exposure with NVDA and APPL for $X. The deliverable is that plan for a fixed fee (which you can technically ""take or leave"") without transferring your assets under the CFP's management.",SuperiorTuba,1,,,2025-10-13 20:36:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5hji1/retired_this_week_what_to_do_with_my_nvidia/njbfgym/

It's day-to-day communication and sharing random stuff from your daily life. I'm part of 3 different friend groups and we have a snap group for each. We use it daily. Share all kinds of stupid shit and talk to each other mostly on there. My nieces and nephews use it the same way.

Basically, if you are in any kind of class - elementary school, high school, college, uni, what ever - there is a snap group for your class where you coordinate, communicate and share things. No one here messages their friends on insta og whatsapp to hang out or chat - it's literally all on Snap.   
Insta is more for showing off pictures of your vacation - and flirting in my experience. Snap is for daily communication when you want people to reply fast.

1o5rv82,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"ZVRA DD/YOLO ~$70k (5,000 Shares + Jan 10 Calls)","This one’s been slept on, but it’s in a position with very limited downside and significant short-term upside. Zevra transformed itself when it bought arimoclomol from Orphazyme in 2022. That drug, now branded MyPlifa, has since been approved, and **the company is generating $26M per quarter (and growing)**. On top of that, **they added $148M in cash to the balance sheet from the sale of a Priority Review Voucher** they received from the FDA. How much did they pay for this drug? A whopping **$12.8M in cash**.

They’ve also submitted for approval in the EU, which has a large unmet need that MyPlifa addresses. Per-patient revenue will be lower than the US, but the candidate population is much bigger. The company is cash-rich, low debt, revenue-growing, and expected to hit official positive earnings during their November call.

Last quarter, the exec team downplayed the impact of the PRV sale by excluding it from net revenue, and clouded positive news with a non-cash impairment and inventory write-down tied to another acquired drug, Olpruva, citing cautious uptake expectations. The optics from earnings showed a net loss, but in reality, they had a massive quarter.

Institutional buyers have been ramping up ownership over the past year, and even the lowest analyst rating is almost double the current price. My strong opinion: this company is prepping for a buyout, and multiple rumors of offers have surfaced recently. Whether that happens or not, the fundamentals are improving fast, and the stock price will eventually meet reality.

The current short-term drop is due to the CEO tax selling 19,500 shares on Friday after 50,000 RSUs vested that same day. Totally normal behavior that would have been planned as early as 2023 when the RSUs were awarded.....and today’s reactionary dip should bounce back quickly. (Edited for clarity)

**I’m holding 5,000 commons and Jan 10 calls for the potential M&A pop. Any further drop and I’ll add more calls, or roll if no buyout announcement before earnings. Conservatively, I expect a sale in the $20–$25 range.**

njbd6fs,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I'm bad at handling winners; when to add more or take profit,"Expand your extended forecast (mix of personal gut feelings and research) to longer than a week, longer than a month, longer than a year (optimally for taxes). Buy more of the stock in dips. If it's in the red this week but you trust the company has a good platform for growth, hold or buy another share while it's cheap. Consider it on sale.

It sounds like you want to trade instead of invest, which you can do to make money but you have to be on it like a hawk and you're more likely to stress yourself out watching the value go up and down every day or week. If you are investing think less about selling and more about waiting until it's 'on sale' to buy more. Sell only when your confidence has completely eroded in the company and you are still in the green. I'll never sell if it's in the red because you lock in your losses. Just let it mature, and if your strategy was only buying more in dips you're more likely to see it back in the green again sooner than the average shareholder.

Tech stocks are highly volatile, so if you look at it everyday you'll drive yourself nuts. Sometimes it's worth selling it all just because of that, or put a sell limit order on it based on a good guess on past volatility peaks, walk away, and don't look back.",ynfive,1,,,2025-10-13 20:25:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5r4br/im_bad_at_handling_winners_when_to_add_more_or/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5r4br/im_bad_at_handling_winners_when_to_add_more_or/njbd6fs/

Professional traders often layer position sizing, partial profit-taking, and trailing stops with an analysis of volatility, sector cycles, and macro catalysts—so you can lock gains while still participating in potential upside. There’s also a strategy of scaling in and out incrementally rather than all-or-nothing moves, which helps balance growth and risk, especially with small capital. I’ve been working on a practical method for applying these techniques in real-world portfolios, and it’s helped avoid exactly the “what if I sold more?” scenario you’re describing.

Just bought 80 of the ALIT 21 Jan 2028 Calls.

Why I think ALIT (Alight) can do very well from here:

\- Alight's biggest customers include over 6**0 Fortune 100 companies and 220 Fortune 500 companies** using their services.    
  
\-**Market cap of $1.66B**, with annual revenue of $2.33B, with management targets of 46% revenue and 60%+ EPS growth by 2027.

\- **Stealth AI play at $3/share-** Alight has been quietly implementing AI products and services this year, drastically reducing costs and optimizing their business solutions. They rolled out **LumenAI** to personalize employee benefits, automate tasks, and provide actionable insights for employers. *""Alight’s AI-powered analytics can help employers identify trends and patterns in their data, while our AI-powered decision support can help employers make better decisions about HR and benefits.""*

\-**95% of Alight customers are contracted**, for recurring revenue. If they can leverage their AI offerings, they can grow margins significantly.

This stock and this company has all of the right ingredients for a retail traders to get in and see the opportunity before insitutions notice. They have the right tools, theyre asset light, and we can help get this one off the ground 🚀

At some point you also run into the issue of materials.

1o5r4br,post,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I'm bad at handling winners; when to add more or take profit,"Just looking for some insight as what to do when a stock is doing really well. I'm here kicking myself because I could have handled it better, and what to do if I get this kind of scenario again.

A while ago, I bought a tech stock (VRT) at $20 a piece. I did do research on the company before buying and I liked them, plus it rounded out my small portfolio. I don't have a lot of money to invest, but I'm trying, so I only bought 7 shares. It doubled, so I sold 2. Fast forward a few months and it had doubled again, so I sold 2 more. Reinvested that into an ETF for the long term which is also doing pretty good. But that only resulted in a couple hundred bucks. Decided to hang on to the remaining 3 because it was doing well and waited to see what it would do. 

Even within the last few months, it seemed to have settled around $120 and then \[news happened\] and it pumped an extra $50 a share over the course of about 2 weeks, where I hadn't been checking my account. So now the 3 shares I still own are something like 730% value. I realized that I don't know if I should keep them, sell them, or add more because this company keeps doing great, but I also realize part of that in this specific case is the AI boom which could continue for years or blow up tomorrow if Grok turns into Mecha-hitler again. I can't really afford whole shares at $150+ either. 

 I think I have probably missed out on 2-3 big run ups by playing it too safe / not being aggressive enough, but then a few of the stocks where I go ""this is it, buy more!"" turn red the next week. Is there a method for this kind of decision or is it just instincts and deep diving the companies to understand everything about them? I would have made a really good play if there were three 0's on the end of both values, but I can't throw those kind of numbers around. As a very novice investor who works for a living, what can I do to determine when to add more to a stock with momentum compared to when I should pull profit because it is up 200%? 

tl;dr - Picked a stock, it did really well, but could have made actual money if I had put in more at the start, looking for advice on when to add more or when to take profit and high-five myself for a good percentage gain.

njb65hx,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"I’m in a similar situation. Heavy tech due to RSUs. I am selling as much former employer stock as I can without jacking my long term capital gains taxes through the roof. You’ll have to pick your number, 15%, 18.8% or 23.8% and fill out that tax bracket. For me, it is 18.8 but sometimes I think this is going to take too long and my efforts will be eclipsed my market gains. Do take a look at state tax treatment for LTCG. Here in California, the state tax bracket is 9.3% out to nearly $700k, which is around the start of the 23.8% federal bracket, but if I push harder, not only will I get 5% extra federal, but another 4% California tax lumped on for a total of 37.1%, plus some extra bonus millionaire assessments to support mental health and such. 

NVIIDA has way, way more exposure to AI than Apple, so I’d start there. Apple won’t be immune because it is in the same ETFs with the AI majors, but should bounce eventually when sanity returns. NVIDIA just needs some competition or a large pullback in spending and it is sunk, a shadow of itself and will stay that way for a while, probably through the next crash, or so I believe. That said, long term, Apple needs to recommit to engineering or suffer decline.

If you are holding some losers - tough in this market -  then you can sell those too and use those losses to cancel some of the gains for tax purposes. See Tax Loss Harvesting.

Your broker is probably also running a stock exchange program. They take your stock and a bunch of other investors stock, toss it together into a mini-fund, make you wait 7 years for tax magic to occur, then you get back a bunch of stock from the other companies in the fund, and a little of your own. This will not spark capital gains tax (yet) but at the end of the day, you will be left holding a pile of different single stocks rather than just NVidia. What is this pile of tripe they give you? Well it is all the stuff that other people had too much of and didn’t want — GE! Yay! — but at least you are diversified some.  There is a big difference between this and an actual ETF, which can trade in kind with every stock in the market and keep itself current. You are still owning a bunch of single stocks which over the decades will one by one go dark due to age and mismanagement with no tax efficient way to replace them with new stuff. The 7 year lock in may problem too.

1o5q1z6,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Finally green on a year!,"Been an options degenerate since 2019 thanks to this subreddit. Have blown multiple accounts, even lost  a hard earned 40k in a couple days in 2024, made most of it back, then lost it again on regarded options trading that next week. I had tried switching to shares multiple times the last couple years but as soon as i make a little side play on options that nets me enough to get my confidence back it would snowball into blowing half my account in a day, then hating myself for not having discipline. I started out this year strong holding my ASTS shares but my fear and greed chopped up my account into dust (options again ofc), having to restart from 0 early in the year. I told myself i would buy ABAT (around 10k shares at $1.5) due to it trading for dirt cheap and having some positive news catalysts coming out for their lithium recycling business, combined with a trump administration that would probably prioritize american companies especially rare earths. At many points i would relapse into options, catching myself selling some abat here and there to gamble with a thousand or two, watching my losses pile up again. I even broke the PDT rule on purpose to stop myself from being able to trade, while still holding my then 6350 abat shares. Couple months later and here we are, abat touched 10 dollars today and while i did sell too much at 3,4,5,6 etc, i can't complain about how much i've netted on this stock (about 22k so far). I have diversified much of my abat gains into other hot sectors but i do recognize that this rally will not last forever, and am always willing to take profit and reposition. I still do some option plays on the side but i make it a point to not put on a position that would bother me at all, maybe a couple % of my account max. I still have some ways to go before finally being in the green overall, but for me this milestone is huge and made me realize how quickly capital can build up when you're not actively trying to destroy it.

njaz42r,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Do you hedge tail risk on iron condors?,"Thanks for your response. 

Curious though on what you would’ve done if you opened the 6660/6650 put spread with a 6830/6840 call side on last Thursday, expiring October 17. Previous trade with the same set up was about 1.50 per side. Always do 9 away from spot for the short put, 10ish away from the short call.  Usually 10 contracts per side. 

Here’s what I would have done, any feedback?

1.  Friday, markets tank, close the call side to crystallize profit and free up margin. Probably could’ve closed it at .50 cents. Net profit is now $2.50

2. Markets blew past my yellow light / red light indicators. I would’ve rolled the put side if once markets around 6685, but it’s far too late for that as spot is now 6600. Fully ITM, roughly $6 to buy back. 

3.  Now I either roll into an extremely choppy market, get at least 3.50 on the new spread to breakeven, and then hope for a rebound. 

OR buy back at $6, take the $3500 loss as part of the game and then re-enter to make this back when I feel comfortable. 

OR hope the market rebounds. This is not a choice, as I’ve been burned heavily on this before and know hope is not a strategy. 

Really don’t like any of these choices. First one is the most optimal, but you’re still taking on $10,000 of risk for zero reward. 

Any thoughts?",ReplacementEasy50,1,,,2025-10-13 19:19:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5oqwp/do_you_hedge_tail_risk_on_iron_condors/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5oqwp/do_you_hedge_tail_risk_on_iron_condors/njaz42r/

njausfp,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Looking for advice: Buying Vs Renting an Apartment,"if you don't plan on living there forever, investing the difference will probably leave you with a significantly higher net worth 5-10 years out when you end up moving. buying also costs a lot more than the mortgage - you have to factor in property taxes, maintenance costs of usually around 1% of the property value a year, the overhead of having to fix or replace everything yourself every time something breaks. and if you live somewhere with rent control, the difference is even worse because you probably won't be able to pin your interest rate for very much longer either in most EU countries.

to help you calculate, calculate how much actual equity you'd be building per month versus interest. this + 1% of the property value / 12 is your 'rent', i.e. the money you will just be throwing into a void. how much will you have actually paid off in 10 years, i.e. how much would you get back out of the investment? then you can calculate the property price going up by somewhere between 2-7% a year minus any potential taxes you may have to pay upon selling and see where you end up netting. compare that to taking the cash you would put into the flat into the market and assuming a 5-12% appreciation year over year. in the vast majority of cases, you will end up better-off if you invest in the markets.

obviously no one knows what the future holds and anywhere you put your money is risky, but so is keeping it and waiting to see what inflation does. we're all just taking calculated risks based on informed probabilities.

edit: full disclosure, we bought last year because we found a flat slightly below market price and we kind of regret it. the tricky thing is that the whole process of putting in an offer and getting a mortgage forces you to make these big decisions really fast, so it's best to just run as many numbers as possible so you have an intuitive grasp on all these levers",h0neycakeh0rse,4,,,2025-10-13 18:58:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o5d4u5/looking_for_advice_buying_vs_renting_an_apartment/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o5d4u5/looking_for_advice_buying_vs_renting_an_apartment/njausfp/

njas95g,comment,stocks,META,Meta Platforms Inc.,"No matter what happens with the ‘AI bubble’, Nvidia was f*cked from the beginning","Have you actually considered that their earnings could decline? It's not just margin pressure from competitors, but also risk of declining volume:

1. Right now AI makes up the majority of VC funding. Big tech is spending the majority of their cash flows on datacenter buildouts for cloud capacity to sell to these VC funded firms, and then using the revenue they earn from selling AI capacity to fund these startups. Many, such as Meta and Oracle, are starting to rely on debt.

2. 95% of AI projects are failing to achieve revenue growth or cost savings, as per a MIT study. How can 25-35% growth in earnings be sustainable if AI is not providing a solid return on capital?

3.Tech has shown historically it can pivot very quickly:

In the .COM bubble, telecoms and computer hardware manufacturers grew very quickly, but then earnings nosedived very quickly as capital dried up

In 2020-2021, pretty much every major tech company was going to great lengths to hire as many engineers as possible, to the point they were hiring people to do nothing, just to have them on the bench. Engineers were seen as in short supply, so it became a competition to build a skilled team. All it took was 1 MAG7 company starting layoffs to get every single major tech company copying each other cutting headcount the past few years.

My point with the above is AI can be very similar. Right now, all of big tech is aligned to compete to build as much AI compute capacity as possible. If just 1 big tech company signals caution with AI and starts backing off datacenter investments and hardware purchases, the entire industry could follow very quickly.",skilliard7,1,,,2025-10-13 18:47:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/njas95g/

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

I’m trying to figure out a good way to hedge Friday’s move without spending too much. Let’s ignore the rebound today as that’s not always guaranteed. 

Noticed a “fully ITM” 10-pt spread isn’t really $10 until expiration usually trades around $6–$7 a day or two before expiry. Always feels this is too costly to roll and not economical either. If I roll for a small debit I’m still left with the same exposure, which I’ll either need to close early or re-roll. 

So I’d rather spend a bit upfront on insurance. Yes might cost more but it’ll help me sleep at night.
Does anyone have a setup for this? 
An ideal put debit spread would roughly cover the cost to close the debit spread ( ie $6,000 to close the credit spread, so I’ll need a debit spread that would have enough Vega expansion/ delta sensitivity to rise to that). 

I’m tinkering away with different otm spreads, widths etc. Wanted to see if anyone else is doing this or if it’s worth it.

If the US is only going to invest in the production then that toxic waste will have to be dumped somewhere into literally cesspool lakes or tailing ponds.

The upfront investment alone will never be economic for example - machinery and input costs might be $4B, with $1B annual maintenance and capex cost to get maybe $700M revenue annually of minerals out. So it will have to be subsidized forever. They're already talking about setting 'floor pricing' to alter the economics but that will only serve or apply to domestic customers because other international markets will be undercut by China.

depending on the funds, it might be OK to just leave this brokerage account alone and let it ride. it's relatively well diversified, so you're not too concentrated in any one thing. small & large cap stocks tend to sort of offset each other, and move a little differently over time (which is a good thing). 

double check with a pro but because it's not a tax-sheltered retirement account, I believe there's no obligation on your part to liquidate the account within any given period of time. so you could just leave it be, and skim off a little bit every so often for expenses or a vacation.",zeppo_shemp,5,,,2025-10-13 18:20:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5o5pb/what_to_do_with_inherited_brokerage_account/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5o5pb/what_to_do_with_inherited_brokerage_account/njamrc1/

The deep down truth is that Putin has some sort of critical, personal leverage on Trump. Whether that's holding debt, the Epstein tapes, or something else, its a classic Kompromat situation. 

Trump has said many, many times he'll end the war, only for it to escalate. All these promises he makes are either half true or completely empty. The more he promises amd fails to deliver, the longer the war goes on. Remember back in 18-19 when he tried to blackmail Zelensky with dirt on Biden? His promises to Ukraine are conditioned by blackmail, and Zel is being foolish thinking he can ever trust Trump. 

I think its highly likely Trump and Putin wamt to divide Ukraine into resource centers. The politics are all a charade as they negotiate who gets what, leaving Ukraine out of the deal.

njak1j6,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Best Way to Invest an Emergency Fund (€40,000) for Safety and Returns in Germany/Europe?","As others have said, 40,000 euros seems like a lot for an emergency fund. The rule of thumb is 3-6 months of basic living expenses (plus around 10% extra of that, just in case) in a highly-liquid bank account. 

In your case, your emergency fund suggests your basic living expenses are between 6,500 and 13,000 euros. 

Awesome if that's within your income range, but otherwise, you're likely saving a bit too much. 

In terms of where to park that, money market funds could work, but just keep in mind that: 

\* You can't immediately access them as they're funds and you have to sell your holdings to get liquid. 

\* Money markets don't work during the weekends. 

\* They don't have depositor guarantee meaning if the fund for whatever reason went broke, you'd have no protection. 

Some techniques you could consider:

\* Re-evaluate your actual liabilities that the emergency fund is covering. For example, if it's to cover repairs or replacements of house appliances or a vehicle, look for either extended warranties and/or insurance products that can cover the cost of repair/replacement without you having to match the replacement value 1:1 in cash deposits. 

\* Break down your living expenses to see how much you'd actually need in an emergency. From there, you could split the funds between a highly-liquid savings account and a higher yield product like a money market fund. This way, you get both liquidity and can benefit from a bit a growth.",abroadenco,3,,,2025-10-13 18:07:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o5iar3/best_way_to_invest_an_emergency_fund_40000_for/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o5iar3/best_way_to_invest_an_emergency_fund_40000_for/njak1j6/

My best guess is that they always made sure to talk us up, even when they would claim we had things or did things that were objectively not true.  We like that.  And to cut us some slack, I guess everyone is prone to flattery.

Trump was a major problem for Ukraine for the first few months.  And it was and is right for us to call him out on that.  But he's also come around and his rhetoric, at least, goes further than Biden's ever did.

So I guess for anyone who simply must hold the Democrats' water here in Europe, nothing will be good enough.  For those of us who just want to see Ukraine win, push Russia to pre-2014 borders, and then stew in the humiliation for the next decade or two: I really could not care any less.

njaijpr,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Missing some key variables, here. Depends on how much you have elsewhere. Is it just the IRAs? You don't say how old you are, I'll assume 58 (where we retired). You also don't say if you're single or MFJ.

Why are you paying a FA to do the IRA and not the whole thing?  Does he give advice on how to handle the funds he doesn't handle? If not, you're just throwing money away - that's exactly what you need help with.

Assuming you have about the same in other retirement funds, and that those will also be taxed as you take distributions, you should (have) retire(d) early enough to start spending down the AAPL and NVDA aggressively for a few years.  Certainly book LTCG all the way up to the top of your 0% bracket, but you've got a lot so you probably ought to book some at 15% LTCG too.  For MFJ, the 0% caps out at around 130k with std. deduction, but remember that's your AGI, so any pension or dividend or interest coming in will eat into that. (EDIT: I had 230k, it's 130k)

The point of Tomahawks for Ukraine is their long range, so they can strike infrastructure deep in Russian territory. Currently the stock of long range munitions Ukraine has is very limited. Typically drones, or an occasional Ukrainian made cruise missile.

Scalps and storm shadows are also precision systems. They are just at best ""intermediate range"", but in reality basically short ranged cruise missiles. And the only European long range missiles produced outside of Ukraine are French, and I dont think they actually have a non-naval launch version.

Right now, I have a mixed portfolio with both crypto and stocks. In stocks, spread across Tesla, NVDA, VOO, SCHD, QQQ and much more.

I’ve been thinking about selling some of my stocks, taking the profits and focusing more on dividend-paying ETFs and passive income for the long run.

What do you guys think about this strategy? 
Would it make sense to shift more toward dividend ETFs like SCHD or JEPI? Any others?

nja5vh2,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Concentration can improve performance at the cost of increased unsystematic risk, and that concentration paid off for you.

Now that you are retired with a valuable portfolio you are out of the wealth accumulation phase and are entering the capital preservation and income generation phase. So am I. You should move from concentration to diversification. Half of your money in just two stocks is too concentrated. You need to diversify.

Your reluctance to pay long term capital gains tax seems to be inhibiting you. Don’t let it. If you are married filing jointly and your taxable income (after deductions) is below $96,700 your long term capital gains tax rate is 0%. Zero percent. If it is above that but below $496,600 the tax rate is 15%. Start selling shares, starting with your highest cost shares. Use the money to diversify into broad index funds, including foreign stock indexes. Keep selling NVDA and AAPL until each is 5% of your portfolio. Consider buying dividend focused ETFs including foreign dividend payers. I’m projected to collect over $70k in dividends over the next 12 months. The tax rates and tax brackets for qualified dividends are the same as for long term capital gains. I also have significant positions in physical gold and silver, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks as insurance against a US dollar and US sovereign debt crisis due to out of control deficit spending and unsustainable costs of servicing the ballooning national debt.

nja43cm,comment,europe,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Trump Offers Putin a Choice: Settle the War—or Face Tomahawks From Ukraine,">Tomahawks are cruise missiles. Whether they are told about what they can or can't be used on is less important than whether they can be used at all.

That's kind of the point of cruise missiles to use them. And the only way to end the war is to put enough pressure on Russia that they leave Ukraine. 

> Either way, using them would negate the peace talks that have been supposedly initiated since the Alaska meet.

There's no real peace talks. Putin wasn't even willing to bend or compromise slightly because he doesn't want peace, he just wants to get Trump on his side which he failed at spectacularly in Alaska. Giving Ukraine cruise missiles will perhaps be the one positive step Trump made towards actually securing peace. 

>Nope, that is evidence of the US telling Ukraine what not to do, but Ukraine doing it anyway.

Sure, because Ukraine wasn't reliant at all on US equipment to carry out the mission. This isn't the case at all with how Ukraine uses US missiles, and Ukraine has actually abided by any weapons restrictions given to them so far. Besides, if Ukraine *didn't* abide by US weapon restrictions on their cruise missiles, how would that then be the fault of the US that would magically turn it into a war between the US and Russia? I still don't get your reasoning here. 

>Which is actually evidence in support of my claim that Ukraine will do things that draw others in to the war,

That's not a thing. There's no way sabotaging Nordstream2 would draw anyone into war nor was that the intention of the sabotage in the first place. 

>All they did was destroy infrastructure of another country which limited their ability to mitigate energy costs

It actually had zero impact on Germany since Germany made zero use of Nordstream 2. All it did was prevent the possibility of Germany changing policy and funding Russia's war machine in the future with gas purchases. The need to mitigate energy costs came from Russia's actions, not Ukraine's. 

>None of them were situations which could have led to direct confrontation, except Cuba.

Ukraine isn't in a situation which could lead to a direct confrontation, so really same difference. You can make up all the imaginary motivations you want, none of it leads to the US and Russia going to war. 

>And that is repeating itself with the US stationing nuclear weapons in the UK back in July as a show of strength.

They were there in the UK in 2008 as well, and your reasoning doesn't make sense. Last time I checked Germany is closer to Russia than the UK, and that's where the US normally parks their nuclear fleet. Any such posturing is pointless anyway, unlike when the Cuban missile crisis happened both sides can hit each other at any time without moving a single nuclear weapon, all thanks to ICBMs and nuclear subs. There's been no way to hide from nuclear war for the last 40-50 years, but it hasn't happened because MAD still works and will continue to work for the foreseeable future.",ZhouDa,2,,,2025-10-13 16:48:21,https://united24media.com/latest-news/trump-offers-putin-a-choice-settle-the-war-or-face-tomahawks-from-ukraine-12413,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o5cj9s/trump_offers_putin_a_choice_settle_the_waror_face/nja43cm/

But just more damage over time adds up, making the war less worth it. If a million dollar missile can take out a 50 million dollar refinery, then the west is winning every day for very little cost

That's billions down the drain, and you've only hit one place! That's how hitting just one target and a threat can force disproportionate impact on the enemy and force them to use extra resources.

#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #21 (risk)

""**Crypto has no 'Counterparty Risk'**"" / ""**Crypto gives you 'financial sovereignty'**"" / ""**Crypto has no 'middlemen'**"" / ""**Trustless transactions!**""

1.  The idea that crypto/blockchain is ""trustless"" is false. With blockchain [you still need to trust various third parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s) -- the difference is there's no accountability.
2.  ""Counterparty Risk"" is defined as the potential for one party in a transaction to default/fail to follow through on the transaction, and is measured in the amount of financial loss/damage that could be caused as a result.
3.  Satoshi claimed in his Bitcoin White Paper that one of the motivations behind creating crypto/blockchain was to eliminate counterparty risk by removing ""middlemen"" from the transaction, specifically financial institutions, which crypto people argue can fail and cause counterparty risk.
4.  Unfortunately, bitcoin/crypto/blockchain does **not** eliminate counterparty risk.  Even in situations where it's strictly a peer-to-peer digital crypto transaction, there are numerous ways in which that transaction can fail and cause counterparty risk.  Here are some examples:
 * Lack of access to hardware necessary to process crypto (smartphones, computers, etc.)
 * Lack of access to electricity (note that electricity is not needed to engage in a P2P fiat transaction)
 * Lack of access to specific wallet/transactional software
 * Lack of access to the Internet (or limited internet access due to firewalls and municipal restrictions)
 * Faulty smart contracts
 * Vulnerabilities or back doors in any of the software being used
 * Not having access to the necessary private keys to execute a transaction
 * Having the system/software/bridge you're using hacked
 * Lack of adequate funding for transaction fees
 * blockchain processing consortium blacklists
 * developments in quantum computing that undermine cryptographic schemes
5.  People argue ""holding bitcoin"" has no counterparty risk.  This is also a lie.  Just because your wallet is secure, doesn't mean your bitcoin is secure.  Here's why:
 * In order to even *exist* crypto is dependent upon an elaborate network of computers running 24/7 - these systems are *not* paid by crypto holders - their participation is totally voluntary.  
 * The moment a node/mining operator doesn't find it economically viable to operate, they can cease operations, and if enough of these people do so, the operation of the blockchain ceases, and nobody will be able to access their wallets and engage in transactions
 * In the case of bitcoin, its proof-of-work mechanism requires a lot of energy and resources to operate. If the price of BTC drops below a certain level, it no longer becomes economically viable to operate the network and **all bitcoin disappears**.
 * Yes, bitcoin's mining difficulty will adjust to address people leaving the industry and become more modest over time, but since the primary motivation for even participating in the network is the attempt to make exponential profit, the moment BTC stops consistently moving up, is the beginning of its demise.  There's no other reason to operate the network if there isn't growth.  And BTC's growth model is 100% mathematically un-sustainable.
 * In short: **There is no guarantee blockchain will operate forever**.  There's already 30,000+ dead cryptocurrencies that are no longer in existence.
5.  In reality, Bitcoin and crypto doesn't eliminate counterparty risk or middlemen.  It simply changes one set of middlemen (traditional, accountable, well-regulated financial institutions) for another set of middlemen (random, anonymous crypto operators and the software and intermediate systems they use, as well as various other local and international communication services).  Anywhere in this chain of necessary resources things can fail, either by intention, negligence, legal mandate, acts of god, or randomly, and it can cause a crypto transaction to not go through.

Some people claim that crypto has less counterparty risk than traditional fiat.  This is a lie.  And they cherry-pick specific ""perfect"" scenarios where there's minimal counterparty risk in crypto *provided* all of the above conditions aren't a problem.  If we're going to fabricate a ""nirvana fallacy"" you can also have the same conditions apply to any alternate system and it too, will have ""no counterparty risk"" so this is a deceptive, disingenuous claim.",AmericanScream,1,,,2025-10-13 16:36:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/nja1oqn/

nja0wh2,comment,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Is the most important selling point of bitcoin actually meaningless?,"> Isn't it just essentially a digital commodity like gold?


#Crypto Talking Point #10 (value)
 
""**Bitcoin/crypto is a 'store of value'**"" / ""**Bitcoin/crypto is 'digital gold'""** / ""**Crypto is an 'investment'**"" / ""**Bitcoin is 'hard money'**"" / ""**Bitcoin has value because of the 'Network Effect'**""

 1.  Crypto's ""value"" is unreliable and highly subjective.  It cannot be used as a currency or to pay for almost anything in any major country.  It has high requirements and risk to even be traded. At best it's a speculative commodity that a very small set of people attribute value to.  That attribution is more based on emotion and indoctrination than logic, reason, evidence, and utility.

 2.  Crypto is too chaotic to be any sort of reliable store of value over time.  Its price can fluctuate wildly based on everything from [market manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984) to [random tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522006333).  No reliable store of value should vary in ""value"" 10-30% in a single day, yet many cryptos do.

 3.  Crypto's value is *extrinsic*.  Any ""value"" associated with crypto is based on popularity and not any material or intrinsic use.  See this [detailed video debunking crypto as 'digital gold'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4446s)

 4.  Even gold, while being a lousy investment and also an undesirable store of value in the modern age, at least has material use and utility.  Crypto does not.  And whether you think gold's price is not consistent with its material utility, if that really were the case then gold would not be used industrially.  But it is.

 5.  The supposed ""value"" of crypto is based on reports from unregulated exchanges, most of whom have been caught [manipulating the market](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21) and [inflation introduced by unsecured stablecoins](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).  There's nothing ""organic"" or ""natural"" about it.  It's an illusion.

 6.  The operation of crypto is a negative-sum-game, which means that in order for bitcoin/crypto to even exist, there must be a constant operation of third parties who must find it profitable to operate the blockchain, which requires the price to constantly rise, which is mathematically impossible, and the moment this doesn't happen, the network will collapse, at which point crypto will cease to exist, much less hold any value.  This has already happened to tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies.

 7. The ""Network Effect"" argument is just the [Appeal to Popularity Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) - Just because something is popular does not make it inherently valuable. Especially if that popularity is primarily based on marketing and coercion and not actual material utility or intrinsic value.

 8. Many of the most trusted, most successful entities in the world of finance do not consider crypto/bitcoin to be a reliable store of value.  Crypto is [prohibited from being used as collateral by the DTC](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2024/4/26/B20002-24.pdf) and respectable institutions such as Vanguard [do not believe crypto belongs in their investment portfolio](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think).

 8.  There is not a single example of anything like crypto, which has no material use and no intrinsic value, holding value over a long period of time across different cultures.  This is **not** because ""crypto is different and unique.""  It's because attributing value to an utterly useless piece of digital data that wastes tons of energy and perpetuates tons of fraud,*makes no freaking sense* for ethical, empathetic, non-scamming, non-exploitative, non-criminal people.",AmericanScream,2,,,2025-10-13 16:32:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/nja0wh2/

nj9z0p7,comment,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Is the most important selling point of bitcoin actually meaningless?,">Reading the comments its clear people still have no idea what bitcoin is or how blockchain works.

This is called [crypto gaslighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=571s).

It's the standard excuse pro-crypto people make when encountering critics: ""You don't understand.""   

Yes, we do understand, which is why you never actually elaborate on what it is you think you know, that we don't.  You just lay that ad hominem down as a distraction.",AmericanScream,14,,,2025-10-13 16:22:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/nj9z0p7/
1o5l1wg,post,stocks,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),"No matter what happens with the ‘AI bubble’, Nvidia was f*cked from the beginning","To understand why we need to know where these companies find themselves in ai. There are four American companies focused on building super intelligence, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Anthropic. Google has been building its own hardware in house (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit) since 2015. Openai as of today (https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/) is building its own hardware, and I wouldnt think it would take long until anthropic and xai get the memo. 

Its important to note that switching takes time, maybe years. However one thing is clear, companies have ever the more incentive to get their compute from providers other than Nvidia. Personally I believe the prospect of a bubble is in many ways overblown. I am not a genie, stocks may crash for a few months but panic will subside and as long as the graphs continue (https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) then AI hype is perfectly proper. 

This all leads me to conclude one thing. As frontier labs like OpenAI build more and more of their own purpose built hardware that allows them to avoid paying the Nvidia tax (think: three OAI GPUs that are 65% as good as an Nvidia one or one Nvidia gpu) we will start to reach a critical point. Hardware design (not production) is one of the more replaceable processes in the AI wars. It not impossible to reverse engineer impressive hardware, poach some smart guy, and build something that is decent. However this is hard to do for AI. You need immense amounts of compute, tons of world class researchers, a good culture, and so so so much capital. Meta’s Super intelligence labs are a great example of this, despite pouring billions they still have nothing to show from it. 


I want to end this by reminding you one thing: I am not a finance bro. I am a tech guy, I never would try to tell you the shape of the Nvidia stock chart, I do however have a lot of experience with AI as my post history would tell you. I am not saying Nvidia is going zero tomorrow, hell I doubt its going to fall in the next six months. However, gravity always wins. Nvidia is on top of the world because for now there are no other options, all I am betting is that competition is bound to arrive.",Trevor050,0,0.46,62.0,2025-10-13 16:21:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o5l1wg/no_matter_what_happens_with_the_ai_bubble_nvidia/

Sell out of the money calls, and use that to buy protective puts at a zero cost sum.  Talk to your advisor about it...even though he only cares about your IRA since he manages it and gets trail revenue off it.

You are going to get hit at 23.8% federal between LTC and Obama health care tax....and state on top it it if that applies if you sell.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-10-17.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",intraalpha,42,0.9,1.0,2025-10-13 16:05:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/

How long would it actually take to withdraw from a money market ETF, government bond, or other investment in case of an emergency (which is, after all, what the emergency fund is for)?

Some banks might offer a small amount of interest on your checking or savings balance, so check if that’s available in your country.

That's not how it works. Ukrainians have never been told how to use their military aid, instead restrictions where put on the weapons as to stuff they *can't* do. Outside of targeting restrictions though its up to Ukrainians how they want to use the weapons, the most the US or any other countries can do is offer suggestions that the AFU is free to turn down. 

>They should be, unless they seem to think that the threat of war among two nuclear-armed nations with Europeans stuck between is something to be taken lightly.

None of that is happening though. Not only is Russia and the US not going to war, but even if such a war were to hypothetically happened nobody is going to be throwing out nukes. Even if Russia's nukes still work the chance of them using nukes goes down if you are fighting another nuclear power because of MAD, same reason why the US won't use nukes either.",ZhouDa,3,,,2025-10-13 15:34:50,https://united24media.com/latest-news/trump-offers-putin-a-choice-settle-the-war-or-face-tomahawks-from-ukraine-12413,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o5cj9s/trump_offers_putin_a_choice_settle_the_waror_face/nj9qa26/

Saw 2 major analysts upgrade NVDA with an Overperform rating and target price of $300/share??  I hold NVDY which would be impacted by a large NVDA drop. Maybe selling some of your NVDA stock to lock in those profits would be a good portfolio move.  Some peace of mind. If the remainder of your shares does go to $300, you are still participating with a nice, safe nest egg. Then if the AI bubble does burst, sell the remainder ASAP to salvage as much profit as possible. Or some variation of that strategy going forward.

nj9htl4,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Retired this week. What to do with my Nvidia,"Look there are a couple options.

There are some more recent papers that say that 100% equity portfolios aren’t inferior to a more stock or bond portfolio as long as you’re at at 4% withdrawal rate. 

That being said I agree with you on the tech bubble. I don’t know when but we are probably gonna have a pop sometime and it will probably come with a pretty big market drop and probably a recession. Crashed early in a retirement portfolio life cycle are extra bad compared to later ones.

You didn’t mention in the context of your overall retirement savings what % nvidia is, but it still makes up 7.5% of the sp500 just by itself… so if you are all in on voo 7% of your worth is nvidia. What is your TOTAL exposure to nvidia: personal stocks +7% of sp500 holdings. If it’s more than 20% is definitely trim back to at least that number.

I personally am selling my nvidia this week as well. Partly bc of bubble fears though the other thing concerning me is we’re starting to see a rising number of vendor financing deals between different ai companies and nvidia is part of several of them. Any stumble from any part of the chain will make the whole pyramid collapse even worse than before. To me it’s enough of a shock to my thesis I think I’m going to take my profits. But that’s just me. 

I haven’t seen apple as involved in many of these deals but same logic as far as portfolio % applies.

As far as tax implications that’s a better question for an accountant, but typically you want to sell from tax advantaged accounts first and brokerages last. But that being said, I wouldn’t let the tax tail wag the dog on making smart decisions, jsut make sure you earmark some do the profits for taxes 

Also remeber it’s not all or nothing, you could for example sell 1/2, or 10% a month for thr next 12 months or whatever .

As far as safer places to go I think TIPS bonds are about as safe as it gets if a bit boring. If you want to stay in equities brk b is about as safe as it gets.

nj9hfnz,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I need to consult the dividend experts here.,"Do you have a financial plan at all? You know emergency fund, eliminate high interest debt, retiring at X, save % into retirement plan, own a house by 20xx, asset allocation by age and/or risk tolerance etc.

$130K is a great start, or an accelerator not a solution in its own right. You don't need a new plan unless you don't have one already. To accelerate your plan make sure you're maxing your Roth IRA, then maxing your Roth 401K, you're young and in a low tax bracket, tax deductions aren't worth anything, but decades of tax free compounding is.

Money is fungible, if you are contributing $10K to your retirement, then pulling $2K in dividends to supplement you income then you've just reduced your net contributions to $8K, well you could just contribute less.

A HYSA for anything more than the emergency fund is a waste of time and money, you'll barely keep up with inflation.

He said he’s not particularly worried about my individual stocks, because even though they are tech heavy, (apple, Nvidia, Shopify, Netflix) they are good companies and since I don’t need the money right away, he thinks I should let them ride. I’m more worried than he is about locking in some gains. He doesn’t actively manage my personal portfolio, but will give general advice. I  own my house, don’t have much debt, and we live on about 5-6k a month, averaged out with paying school and property taxes, insurance, etc. I talked to a bunch of 1% AUM guys before I settled on him. He seems to be honest and also flat fee, so I felt comfortable with him.

nj9dujy,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Moving from Belgium to Prague — worth it for a family?,"Sure but it's not how things work here. Those huge malls with everything under one roof are usually at the outskirts of bigger cities and not in smaller towns or in city center.

I grew up in a small town and there are multiple butchers, bakeries and veggie stores just around the corner while supermarket is much further away. I have something similar in Prague as well. If I want fresh bread, meat or fruit/vegetables it's just around the corner and also along the way to tram stop. So you really don't have to travel to 5-6 different places. They are generally clustered in one street or a square so going into all places doesn't take more time than walking through a huge mall.

Another thing is many people who live outside big cities usually grow a lot of fruit and vegetables at their own yards, they often have eggs, rabbits etc. Also people are used to make a lot of homemade things from basic ingredients. Especially if they don't like the price/quality ratio. I make our own jam from fruit that we get from relatives. It's very simple, just fruit, sugar, pektin and a few minutes of cooking. That's something people in the west often forgot and rely on supermarkets with everything.

I'd never buy spreads in supermarkets, I always prefer homemade ones.
Here supermarkets virtually compete with home cooking and homemade products a lot. The mentality of people here is more oriented towards comparing price/quality of finished product vs input ingredience and when you know you can easily make it at home with fraction of cost from basic ingredients then you will not buy it at the supermarket. They then push the quality down so they can compete only with price.

I remember visiting Dutch AH hypermarket when I was in Dutch family during student exchange when I was at school. They didn't cook at all - they had huge aisles of packaged ready-to-eat complete meals that they just reheated at home. It was not super tasty but ok for what it was but here you mostly find just low cost but really poor quality products. Because it is really hard to compete with home cooking at the similar price level/quality even if you include your time so the supermarkets just try to be cheaper because the more expensive but better product would not stand a chance next to home cooking and then it even enters the price level of lunch menu in restaurants so those products cannot really exist here.

Also a thing to note - there is no Czech supermarket chain and it also effects the way they operate here, their main goal is to send money to their home country not care about their good name / quality and local customers. Tesco in UK/ AH in NL / Kaufland or Lidl in DE are really something different than a Czech branches.",Qwe5Cz,1,,,2025-10-13 14:17:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/nj9dujy/

I’ve been investing through XTB and contributing to CSPX.UK, as it was the closest ticker I could find to track the S&P 500. Since I couldn’t find an S&P 500 ETF in euros at the time, I went with CSPX.UK, which tracks the index in British pounds. However, this introduces currency conversion risk.
After 5 years, my investment is around £12,000. I’m wondering what the best next step is. Should I keep my money in CSPX.UK, or would it be better to withdraw and reinvest in an S&P 500 ETF that tracks in euros to avoid currency risk? Any advice or experiences with similar situations would be greatly appreciated!

1o5hdxa,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,$UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD),"Okay I know what you're all thinking.

>iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡

Normally that’s the right call. Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.

But if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.

Here's why:

# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:

1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.
2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.
3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.
4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.
5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues and no need to scramble for cash.

# So what are the risks?

1. China and the U.S. suddenly make a deal and China floods the market with cheap rare earths. Could it happen? Maybe. Will it? No. The U.S. isn’t going to keep letting China hold this over their head. It’s literally a national security issue, and the Section 232 investigation report that is supposed to come out later this month will support that. The government *HAS* to build domestic supply.
2. Short term profit taking: The stock has gone straight vertical so I definitely admit that people will look to lock in gains here and there. However, I don’t see anyone dumping heavy until major catalysts play out (like the DOE meeting, potential government deals, Section 232 investigation, etc.).

**TLDR:** $UUUU is the only U.S. company producing both uranium and heavy rare earths right as the government is scrambling to cut off dependence on China, launching a $1B stockpile, holding a DOE meeting on nuclear energy Tuesday, and wrapping up the Section 232 national security report - all catalysts that can drive the price higher.

nj93xap,comment,europe,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Trump Offers Putin a Choice: Settle the War—or Face Tomahawks From Ukraine,"Tomahawk is a much more advanced missile system than flamingo.

In its longest range variant it can reach over 2500km (even the shortest range, oldest versions are 1300 or 1600 iirc), flamingo is advertised to reach about 1000km. Tomahawk is available in large numbers, flamingo is not. Tomahawk is somewhat stealthy and flying low, hugging terrain to remain undetected, flamingo likely not as much.
And the fact of the matter is that flamingo isnt battle tested, tomahawk is. We dont know if the flamingo tech specs are real or propaganda, we know that tomahawk works exactly as advertised.

So it is a more advanced, more numerous system, i wonder ehy they might want some of them…

nj90hv1,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Can anyone convince me that DIVO isn’t the best dividend ETF out there?,"The diversity of SCHD vs QQQ is quite well suited for investors looking to diversify away from tech. When SPY is so tech heavy, it stops being as useful for balancing out a portfolio. In a similar vein, a broad market crash will presumably trigger a flight to safety and greater value placed on current income. 


The detractors from SCHD often fail to factor in the rare/unprecedented market conditions for the past 15 years when setting expectations for the fund. Bonds and even gold have each underperformed for several years during that time period. The performance of higher risk investments has been great for many people, though it shortens some people's memories. it's easy to look like a rockstar fund manager in an overall bullish market that lasted roughly a decade after the GFC. Even the COVID stimulus spending helped avoid a much more severe and lengthy correction. The following inflation made dividends a lower priority, especially when bonds could mimic the income with safety and more speculative funds/companies were continually seeing new ATH's. Those conditions could change rapidly.


As you alluded to, the desirability of SCHD depends on many individual factors, often subjective. If a fund like this has a role in the investor's long term portfolio, the differences between similar funds becomes a bit overblown. There's simply no reason to chase the next most popular ETF with more capital appreciation. If a person wants more price action or income, there are choices to match that. No reason for some to bash SCHD in the process or frame the debate against it. The emphasis on dividend growth companies alone makes SCHD more desirable and inherently a long term focused investment.",my_name_is_gato,1,,,2025-10-13 12:31:50,https://i.redd.it/7n3kqk18ipuf1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o4tcti/can_anyone_convince_me_that_divo_isnt_the_best/nj90hv1/
nj90fbp,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Moving from Belgium to Prague — worth it for a family?,"I (sole salary with 2 kids) moved the other way; from Prague to Germany in 2019. For the main factors we moved (salary, kids' education, corporal punishment for kids was not illegal); you have no issues with your salary, education can be absorbed with your salary and corporal punishment in CZ is beginning to be outlawed.

As we owned our own apartment; I was looking at 200k (\~8k EUR) gross as a target if I was going to stay in Prague; and in the end, I was not able to get it there.

The fact that you are able to get it would mean that you have a comfortable enough basis to be able to support your family; even if alone initially.

My feelings for Prague is complicated. It's still one of our favorite cities; even though with kids there would be challenges since it's still a city. Also; language and education will always be a challenge, since your only option is semi-private (best bang for budget) or private.

Having said that; you would be able to afford the education; and you can always choose to live out towards the outskirts to be able to be comfortable for the kids, but local language proficiency will always be a looming shadow.

Food quality although an issue; was at most, a minor irritant at most. There are plenty of options and Prague (in Sapa); has one of the largest Asian fresh markets in Europe.

If your $$$ fits; Prague's exposure as a not-too-big, capital city; is neigh unbeatable.

nj8t7ab,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Bitcoin: I am a new investor in the space. Convince me to hold long term and believe in crypto, or convince me this has no utility and I sell after a little profit.","Bitcoin and all other crypto concerns are not something a person invest in. Crypto is based purely on price and speculation. It isn't something you buy, like a stock for instance, that has an intrinsic value. The price of crypto is just whatever someone is willing to pay for it. Or, think of a bond. A bond has an intrinsic value, because you know what your return will be as soon as you buy it 

Also, crypto is not a store of value like gold nor is it really legal tender. You can't go into a store to purchase an item and then pay for that item with crypto. Yes, there are some businesses that do accept Bitcoin as payment, but these places are currently in the strict minority. But, I will agree with you in saying, who knows what the future holds.

Finally, the biggest issue the massive volatility of crypto currencies. People buy Bitcoin with the thought that it's going to always go up in price. But, like many other investment assets, can and will go down. I think many people treat Bitcoin and other crypto currencies as potential lottery tickets, that they hold on to hoping to strike it rich. Crypto doesn't work like that.

But, if you're still convinced that Bitcoin and crypto is right for you, I suggest you really do your homework before putting any real money on the table. ☺️",Background_Drama6126,1,,,2025-10-13 11:19:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5bpht/bitcoin_i_am_a_new_investor_in_the_space_convince/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5bpht/bitcoin_i_am_a_new_investor_in_the_space_convince/nj8t7ab/

nj8r5i0,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Looking for advice: Buying Vs Renting an Apartment,"Both cases are feasible. When buying make sure to consider property tax, house insurance, building fees etc. 
Regarding the upcoming renovations, I would try to negotiate and deduct them from the overall price. 

I am in a similar case , me and my wife purchased an apartment around the same price. We made sure that the apartment is easily “rentable” if we decide to leave or move to a bigger house after having more children. When deciding, we made sure the house is near public transport, convenient for grocery shopping, and has a nice balcony. Even if after 5 years we decide to rent out and the rent doesn’t cover the full mortgage and fees; the difference can be something we can allocate money to as an investment. 

If you’re not maxing out your credit, you can still buy a smaller rental property in a couple of years as an investment as well. 

From your options I see you’re mostly looking at this for an expenses point of view. I dont think any city has a 10% increase every year on rent, if so the government would stop it. It can happen under certain circumstances, but for sure not in the long term.

I was asked why I think something is valuable. This leads to a discussion about the future, which can become philosophical. The world is not static, monetary systems have changed throughout history. Are you suggesting that central banking is an end state for finance?

> It doesn't matter if something is intrinsic or whether it's part of the technological system. The reason doesn't really matter as much as the fact that the problem exists and is not going away any time soon.

It certainly does matter, because the current financial paradigm does not allow for the envisioned utopia to exist, whereas cryptocurrencies do. It’s never going to go away if you don’t work on it.

> Behavior is 90% of the discussion when it comes to money and investing, so just shooing it aside unfortunately is not an option. Your assumption of extreme technical and financial literacy along great personal responsibility is very unrealistic in a world where a monkey shooting darts is a better investor than 90% of people.

Unfortunately for your argument I can simply point out that technological literacy has been increasing exponentially across all layers of society. It’s not out of reach for me to assume that people will eventually become literate rough to be able to store a 24 word seed phrase.

> They are when there's such a high risk of falling victim to many problems that they're not even aware of. There's a dozen very likely and scary scenarios that can happen to you if you have a significant amount of cryptocurrency. But most people don't even know what those are. At least with stocks, you know the kind of bullshit that happens. We've known them for centuries.

Again. It’s a choice. Ignorance is not a valid defense when an adult assumes responsibility for their own finances.

> Used correctly, anything can be great tool. But, at the moment, cryptocurrencies have many more downsides than benefits.

They appeal to me. Therefore, you are calling me financially illiterate. Again this is weak discourse. Not convincing in the slightest.

> This is what it always comes down to as always.

1o5d4u5,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Looking for advice: Buying Vs Renting an Apartment,"My husband (39M) and I (34F) need to make a decision whether we want to buy an apartment or continue renting. We are trying to have at least 1 child. We're both risk averse and we're not set on living in the current city till the rest of our lives. 

**Buying scenario:**

The apartment costs 450,000 EUR in a major city, we have money saved for the down payment. The price for the market is good (slightly below market value), although the market itself is crazy. The apartment is 110 sq.m. living area, in a very good neighborhood, 2BR, good layout, furniture is oldish (20+ years) but it would not require any major renovation in the next 5 years.

The potential mortgage would be 1700 EUR per month. That’s less than 30% of our income for now, but if the interest rates go up and one of us loses their job, we may be struggling. Current interest rates are on the lower end so the chances of interest rising are real. 

If we want to change the furniture to make it nicer, we’ll need to invest around 20-25,000 EUR at least.

There are upcoming renovations in the building that would cost between 3-5,000 EUR.

We’ll not be paying a realtor fee in this case.

**Continue renting scenario:**

Similar apartments in the area cost between 1,100 and 1,300 EUR per month.

Rent prices are going up in the area and supply is limited. The potential rent may increase with 5-10% on a yearly basis.

We want to rent long-term but there is always a chance to have to move after 1-2 years due to the landlord changing their opinion.

We can invest the down payment money in ETFs, stocks & other instruments.

**Options:**

1. **Buy the property** – we plan on living in the area for the next 5-10 years. After that, there is a chance we’d want to move. We don’t consider this apartment our forever home. There is also an element of FOMO in this case as the offer itself is good. But we’ll be locking a lot of money for at least 3-5 years before being ready to sell it. And there is no guarantee we won’t sell at a loss. On the other hand, prices are expected to continue rising and I am not sure if we'll ever feel comfortable spending that much money on a place.
2. **Continue renting and invest the difference** – the difference between the 2 is at least 500 EUR per month, not taking into account variable costs like changing furniture, appliances or unexpected repairs. We won't have the ""security"" of owning a place and we'll always face the chance of having to move unexpextedly. 

Our long-term financial goal is to either retire early or at least work less when we reach 50-55+.

What would be our better option here from a financial point?

nj8gdh4,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Bitcoin: I am a new investor in the space. Convince me to hold long term and believe in crypto, or convince me this has no utility and I sell after a little profit.","> Banks are not a part of the USD then in the same pedantic way that you can always just carry banknotes with you. No need for a bank at all. It's similarly inconvenient however in reality. 

they literally are part of the USD circuit because they can write loans, therefore increasing the amount of money in circulation even beyond central banking. you can't write a bitcoin loan, because you can't create them in that way.  
 
>  Most people (99.9%) that you recommend Bitcoin to here WILL NOT self-custody their bitcoin, so it's disingenuous to keep arguing it. You also dismiss the risks that come with that. It's actually easier to lose access to a wallet than to lose a big suitcase of cash.  
  
it's not possible to do dollar self custody because someone else controls the supply... the fact that it is systematically possible using bitcoin makes a categorical difference.

> There's a reason currencies are not deflating all the time, and are not wildly fluctuating in value. Bitcoin by definition will always be deflationary and will always wildly fluctuate in value due to its fixed supply. This makes it a terrible currency. It also has no backing by anything (USD is backed by US government), and doesn't produce anything (like gold, unlike stocks), terrible characteristics for an investment vehicle. Therefore, it fails spectacularly at being both.

empirically it does not fail as an investment vehicle because it's been growing in dollar-denominated value at about 70-100% annualized.

> Sure, you could, but you won't. Millionaires with their money in banks don't have to hire private security to guard them all the time. They also have an easier time not talking about it, due to you know ""How can you tell someone has Crypto? They will tell you"". A bank has withdrawal limits, security cameras, and can reverse transactions, along with all the other anti money-laundering laws in place. ""Wrench attack"" is particularly bad for crypto owners.

people disclosing their wealth is not part of bitcoin intrinsically. you are confusing the behaviour of some of its owners with properties of the technology itself. this is not convincing discourse.

> Nothing depends on the competence of other people intrinsically. You can live off the grid and depend on nobody else.  

the value of fiat currency is tied to the competency of central banks and government spending, so yes, it is tied to the competence of other people.  

> In reality, most people are tech-illiterate and depend heavily on all the crypto scammers pretending to be tech experts for their crypto ""investments"". Most regular people know the basics of physical money and bank accounts by now thanks to millennia of using physical currency and centuries of banking.  

again. you are confusing the behaviour of people with a system.

> However, not even 1% of crypto bros can actually explain how cryptocurrencies actually work, which is why even the tech literate ones keep getting scammed constantly. You may even know the technology perfectly, but not know how financial markets generally work, falling victim rug pulls and constant pump and dump schemes in an unregulated market, again with no recourse.  
  
over and over you are confusing the behaviour of people with a technological system. the system allows you to do certain things (three things that I listed). people falling victim to scams is not an intrinsic part of that system, but tied to wrappers built around the system. when someone falls victim to a rug pull or some sort of pyramid scheme, that is an exploitation of human nature or stupidity. it has nothing to do with bitcoin exclusively. the technology allows people to assume full responsibility over some arbitrary ""coin"" - an imaginary number. it's a choice. some people want to be able to make that choice, and now can do it.   

the argument that cryptocurrencies are somehow intrinsically more attracting of violence is also weak, because it's easier to keep the value of your cryptocurrencies a secret than it is to keep your bank account a secret: just don't talk about it. your banking information is stored on many servers, so the attack surface is *intrinsically* larger. I don't see why someone is more likely to get clobbered over cryptocurrencies compared to say jewelry or a fancy car.
  
the only argument you make here are ""you assume that people will inform themselves and not fall victim to scams, and this is evidently not the case, therefore the system is at fault"" 
  
OP is asking me to explain bitcoin and why I think it has a future. I did that: I explain the technology, and I explain why people might want to make use of that. your counterclaims boil down to ""people get scammed"" and ""it's a bad currency"". these are not counterclaims to my explanation as to how it works and why I think that's valuable.

Convince me to hold long term and believe in crypto, or convince me this has no utility and I sell after a little profit.",">? Centralized exchanges are not a part of bitcoin just the way lockbox vendors are not part of the US dollar or gold. it's your choice to entrust your property to someone or something. bitcoin allows you to do self-custody.

Banks are not a part of the USD then in the same pedantic way that you can always just carry banknotes with you. No need for a bank at all. It's similarly inconvenient however in reality. Most people (99.9%) that you recommend Bitcoin to here WILL NOT self-custody their bitcoin, so it's disingenuous to keep arguing it. You also dismiss the risks that come with that. It's actually easier to lose access to a wallet than to lose a big suitcase of cash.

>as a currency, it's not ideal for small transactions. it doesn't need to be, either. there are other currencies for that. as an asset, it's been fantastic for everyone who's held for any considerable amount of time.

There's a reason currencies are not deflating all the time, and are not wildly fluctuating in value. Bitcoin by definition will always be deflationary and will always wildly fluctuate in value due to its fixed supply. This makes it a terrible currency. It also has no backing by anything (USD is backed by US government), and doesn't produce anything (like gold, unlike stocks), terrible characteristics for an investment vehicle. Therefore, it fails spectacularly at being both.

>you would hide your wealth regardless, and people also become the victim of violence regardless.

Sure, you could, but you won't. Millionaires with their money in banks don't have to hire private security to guard them all the time. They also have an easier time not talking about it, due to you know ""How can you tell someone has Crypto? They will tell you"". A bank has withdrawal limits, security cameras, and can reverse transactions, along with all the other anti money-laundering laws in place. ""Wrench attack"" is particularly bad for crypto owners.

>it does not depend on the competence of other people intrinsically. people build wrappers around it that do.

Nothing depends on the competence of other people intrinsically. You can live off the grid and depend on nobody else. In reality, most people are tech-illiterate and depend heavily on all the crypto scammers pretending to be tech experts for their crypto ""investments"". Most regular people know the basics of physical money and bank accounts by now thanks to millennia of using physical currency and centuries of banking.

However, not even 1% of crypto bros can actually explain how cryptocurrencies actually work, which is why even the tech literate ones keep getting scammed constantly. You may even know the technology perfectly, but not know how financial markets generally work, falling victim rug pulls and constant pump and dump schemes in an unregulated market, again with no recourse.",literum,1,,,2025-10-13 08:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5bpht/bitcoin_i_am_a_new_investor_in_the_space_convince/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5bpht/bitcoin_i_am_a_new_investor_in_the_space_convince/nj8e2rz/

1o5bpht,post,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Bitcoin: I am a new investor in the space. Convince me to hold long term and believe in crypto, or convince me this has no utility and I sell after a little profit.","Sorry if there is a post similar to this elsewhere, I’m not finding it. 

Explain this to me like I’m a 5 year old…

I will give a little background on my understanding of Bitcoin/crypto. 

I have had many in person conversations with people who love Bitcoin and claim it is the future. For the last 11 years since being introduced to it, I just don’t get it as nobody has been able to explain it to me. It just comes one big frustrating circle jerk. 

I have heard one decent use for Bitcoin, and that is for wiring money outside of the country at a lower transaction fee compared to wiring money. Great!  I can wrap my mind around that, as that is a $35B US market. 

I understand that traditional currency will get devalued over time due to printing more money.  Bitcoin only gets divided as time goes on and no more will be released after a certain date. This is a great theory. So I am now trying to possibly avoid losing 3% due to inflation and the devaluing dollar. 

Sure no more Bitcoin will be created, but new crypto ( or shit coin ) gets created every day. I know, I know, I know all shit coins go down to zero which just leaves Bitcoin. But still, to think Bitcoin can’t be replaced just like AOL, Yahoo, Friendster etc.. would be pretty short sited.  This is not a point I am trying to debate or learn about. 

???????????????
Question… how is Bitcoin suppose to be better than traditional currency?  

After all, the value of Bitcoin here in the US is based on the USD. I have heard many argument made by crypto lovers that the USD is shit. If the USD is shit, then what’s the point of Bitcoin if it is directly correlated to the USD. 

Maybe the better question is, what will it take to drive actually utilization of Bitcoin on a more accepted basis? 

I’ve never walked into a store and saw a price tag on an item that said the cost of this item is .00025 bitcoins. I have not heard of any jobs paying their employees at .00016 bitcoins per hour Even if there was, that cost and profit margin would have been based on USD  calculations. 

Again, I’m not saying Bitcoin or crypto has no utility. I just don’t know why 90% of the population or more actually needs crypto vs a credit card or even cash. 

This is not a topic on “ Cash is going away “.  That will be a separate thread once I am convinced of the utility and stability of Bitcoin. 

I also can’t stop thinking about AOL, Yahoo, Friendster, MySpace, Skype etc…  but these example show that I am thinking crypto in general has a future. Also not to be debated here. This can be a separate thread after I am convinced of Bitcoins utility and stabilty.

As far as dividend investing goes. We have had pretty much a bull market for the past 15+ years. I think we are due for a period of market retrenching or just plateauing for an extended period of time.  People have completely forgotten what it’s like when the market has consecutive down years or fails to go up. Taking that 4% out of a shrinking portfolio will cause people to reflect on their investment strategy.

nj7ona6,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"For ETF investors, can you help me understand the appeal of high dividends?",">Let’s say you have 2 ETFs - Div and NoDiv and let’s assume they have the same market cap and if you have $100k invested. If Div ETF pays a 5% annual dividend and NoDiv ETF pays no dividend, assuming it’s owned in a brokerage account, at the end of the year you’ll have:

>$100k in the Div ETF

>$95k in the NoDiv ETF with $5k in cash

This is an interesting topic for a couple reasons.  In the instance that a distribution is made, it indeed behaves this way.  The stock is adjusted in price, along with outstanding orders, to make everything line up in accordance with the distribution paid out.  This really only applies to the holding over one distribution cycle; over multiple it becomes muddled.

What tends to happen over multiple cycles is that the price will inevitably converge to a certain multiple of its earnings, relative to its presumed growth rate, regardless of whether there is a distribution or not.  The reason being is that the market quickly prices in the expectation that there will be another distribution and earnings will continue to grow at the current expected growth rate.

While this might seem like I am essentially saying the dividend is ""free money,"" it is not.  There *is* a terminal growth rate and last dividend, at least at the current rate.  A prime example of this exists in $WBA.  The dividend grew for a very long time, earnings slowed to the point that the company could not grow anymore, and eventually suffered a collapse as the business model itself fell out of favor.  This was a massive trap that many investors here fell for because of a lack of financial literacy.

A bit off topic there, but now to discuss the high-yielding ETF, presumably some form of derivative-based ETF (i.e. DIVO, SPYI, ULTY, JEPI, etc.).  ETFs like these are hard to evaluate, as the underlying position is a basket of companies that fall under the above criteria, overlayed with some sort of option position, and possibly even replicated using a synthetic strategy.  It would be nigh impossible to evaluate all the companies in the ETF, the options used each week or month (and the premiums they provide), to get a comprehensive picture on the health of the distribution.  

It may just be better to evaluate it by comparing total returns to the index, preservation of NAV, and the tax treatment of the distribution.  If an ETF maintains NAV, has comparable total returns to its underlying, and has preferrable tax treatment like ROC, then it becomes essentially inconsequential which one you choose to invest in.  I prefer to be rewarded for holding the companies I own, and I also prefer to allocate that reward how I see fit, not necessarily back into the company or ETF from whence it came.",ArchmagosBelisarius,2,,,2025-10-13 05:05:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o56bm8/for_etf_investors_can_you_help_me_understand_the/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o56bm8/for_etf_investors_can_you_help_me_understand_the/nj7ona6/

nj7lf7l,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"For ETF investors, can you help me understand the appeal of high dividends?","The answer is quite simple. 

- When you invest in growth, you take risk knowing that your investment may go up 40% in a year and the next year go down 60%. You’re effectively at -20% on your investment across 2 years (This has already happened during Covid, hence why there was a massive exodus and influx to housing market flipping).

- When you invest in income (dividends), you also take risk in the investment that may go down or up. Can take the same approach as the above, but the difference is, you got dividends paid to you every month for 2 years that you reinvested into the stock as it was falling. Keep inmind that as you reinvested each month, you got more shares at lower price and your monthly dividends continued to increase.

Now look at that and pick which one you prefer?

You might have a stock worth 105 and mine is only 100 yet i have 5k that i could invest into something along the lines that could make me more. 

Also i wanna add that in a perfect world with perfect brains logic makes sense, but dividends have a strong tie to become more invested into investing. 
If you get your first x amount of dividend that's something that pills a bill for your internet or restaurant.
Its a free thing now if you get that monthly. It keeps people engaged. Wanting to invest more, even more in growth. Cause its not just a number telling you that you got more money now IF you sell. 
Its an actual payout. 

Your approach is probably better, like a faster car. But i reach my goal and along the way i get morale boosts and happyness from dividends. It keeps me going and engaged. You might reach your goal faster and more efficient, but the way i do it makes me smile and enjoy the ride more. And at any time i want i can use the dicidends without ever touching my actual investments. 

Personally i like a mix of growth and dividends. Growth works better but i enjoy the dicidends much more.

nj7hvf2,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a flaw in this 30–45 DTE ATM cash-secured put + covered call “wheel” strategy?,"selling ATM maximizes theta and gives you the most premium collected, but it also gives you the highest directional exposure. When you’re ATM, delta’s around 0.50, so you’re basically half stock long when short the put, then if assigned you flip and stay half short with the call. It’s just constant delta swings and big gamma risk around the strike.

The reason people go OTM or manage early is to smooth that out. smaller deltas, lower assignment frequency and less capital tied up in wheel rotations that go nowhere in choppy market. ATM wheels can work fine on volatile but upward trending stocks but they’ll underperform or chop you up in sideways ranges since you’re always resetting at the center of max gamma. you’d keep getting assigned and called away near the same price, losing small amounts while collecting premium but never really gaining in my experience.

1o57juv,post,investing,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Is the most important selling point of bitcoin actually meaningless?,"""There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin"". This seems to be the main selling point in a world where governments regularly debase their currencies. However after doing some digging most people who think they ""own"" bitcoin don't actually self custody bitcoin. According to google's AI tool around 85 percent of people who buy bitcoin use a third party custodian. As far as I am aware there is no law that says these third parties must possess 100% of every bitcoin on their own books on behalf of their clients. Hell, as we all know, there is no law that says financial companies must possess 100% of the dollars we all deposit with them (see fractional reserve banking) so why would the government care if they hold the bitcoin on their books unencumbered by other claimants/owners. 

With that being said, the 21 million figure is meaningless if everyone looking at a number of Bitcoin on their computer screen does not actually represent the number of bitcoin they own. The same is true for other assets like stocks, gold, etc...  If you have an account with shares of GLD, you don't actually own gold bars in some vault. There are likely far more claims on gold than physical gold that has ever been mined. The same seems to be the case with Bitcoin, so saying there are ""only"" 21 million bitcoin does not matter if the supply in the marketplace is infinite via third party custodians.",warrenfgerald,528,0.84,735.0,2025-10-13 04:15:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57juv/is_the_most_important_selling_point_of_bitcoin/

nj79flu,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Is there a flaw in this 30–45 DTE ATM cash-secured put + covered call “wheel” strategy?,"Whether you do it ATM or OTM, it’s a short vol position dressed up as income strategy. You make money if realized vol comes in below implied, not because you collected the biggest premium at the first place.

Going ATM gives you the fattest premium but as usual, there is no free lunch. You also have max gamma: at 30/45 dte it is less prevalent but not inexistent. More than ever, especially if you decide to not actively delta hedge, you earn the carry if the stock doesn’t move, but if it does, you bleed faster.

Going OTM shifts/adds some of that premium into skew, meaning you’re getting paid not just for vol, but because people overpay for downside protection vs upside, or vice versa. It is a little more forgiving also if you decide to not delta hedge actively. The trade off is ... well less premium.

Essentially OTM, and around 20 delta strangle are in most cases the closest proxy of IV (computed with model free, not computed with B&S) minus RV and that’s usually where the structural edge sits.

There is nothing wrong with going ATM, as long as you have a view on that VRP using an ATM options: if IV ATM is significantly lower than IV at 20 delta, you may not want to avoid doing that trade ATM.

1o56ghf,post,stocks,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),Sofi's Private Market Funds,"As a shareholder I'm bullish on Sofi's long term outlook in their core business.

BUT I'm skeptical of the private investment funds which they offer. As a retail investor with ~$50k of dry powder, it seems better to just stick with ""boring"" old ETFs and other publicly traded assets. 

What incentive is there to invest a portion of that into any of the funds with $500 minimums such as the Cashmere fund or ARK Venture fund when I'll have to contend with high fees and illiquidity? 

Even the Private Shares Fund with its 2500 investment minimum seems like too low of a barrier to entry to warrant access to any of the best deals.  

Say my motivation to invest in these funds was because of specific companies (i.e. SpaceX with Ark Venture). Wouldn't there just be other, less friction ways of doing so? Investing in Google for instance, which owns a portion of SpaceX, to achieve that same exposure.  

The overwhelming feeling that I'm getting is that retail is the bag holder for PE/VC. Even if the amount of cash I had to invest was to 10x or 100x I'm fairly certain that statement would still ring true. Anyone have any thoughts on this?  

As a shareholder, I'm glad the option to invest is on the platform for other reasons, but count me out of them.

1o56bm8,post,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"For ETF investors, can you help me understand the appeal of high dividends?","So I’ve been a FIRE investor since 2017 and consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable about personal finance and investing. The one thing I never really got is why some people prefer ETFs that pay high dividends, so I figured I’d ask this group. 

First, I should say that I do understand investing in high dividend-paying ETFs if the reason is that you believe those companies are either more stable or will otherwise bring in better returns than broad market funds. 

Other than that, I don’t really get the appeal of dividends as, to me, it’s just being forced to have taxable income in brokerage accounts.

Let’s say you have 2 ETFs - Div and NoDiv and let’s assume they have the same market cap and if you have $100k invested. If Div ETF pays a 5% annual dividend and NoDiv ETF pays no dividend, assuming it’s owned in a brokerage account, at the end of the year you’ll have:
- $100k in the Div ETF
- $95k in the NoDiv ETF with $5k in cash

For me, I don’t understand why you’d want that $5k in cash. I’d rather have it all in NoDiv ETF until I wanted to sell it (and then I’d sell exactly what I needed and sell in the most tax-advantaged way possible). 

FWIW, if you’re investing in single stocks and aren’t reinvesting the dividend, I understand why some investors would want the dividend more (as for some long-term shareholders, like for Sears, if you didn’t have dividends and never sold, your holdings would have gone down to $0 and the dividends would have been the only profits you made), which is why I’m focusing this question on high dividend-paying ETFs. 

I am *not* saying my way of investing is better, so I’m hoping no one gets defensive. I really would like to learn more about why it is you prefer dividend investing and if there’s something you think I’m missing.

Since you’re fine with owning the stock and collecting premium both ways, what’s the actual downside here? Why do most people stick to selling OTM and closing early instead of doing this? Am i missing any major flaw in this logic? Curious to hear the communities thoughts.

1o54fpw,post,investing,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Rough DCF-like valuation without spreadsheets!,"This is a way of doing DCF very roughly without using spreadsheets.



1. Estimate year N revenue and profit (NOPAT, Earnings, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT) margins.

2. Estimate year N exit multiple based on likely perception of company at year N, and calculate EV at year N.

3. Estimate year N net cash by estimating how much free cash flow company will generate from year 1-N, and adding it to initial net cash. Then add this to EV at year N to get Equity value at year N. (Can skip this step if assumption is free cash flow close to 0)

4. Take equity value at year N and initial market cap, and calculate CAGR. Compare this CAGR to my required rate of return. If high enough, consider investment.



Pros of this method:

\- Simple - just need a feel for where revenue and margins will be in N years' time, so you can focus on what really matters.

\- No need for a discount rate - you get a CAGR which you can compare to whatever is your required rate of return. 

\- Easy to compare to other investments, as it's just comparing which has higher CAGR. 

Cons of this method:

\- You have to take a pretty big guess at the company's reinvestment efficiency. However this could be mitigated using guidance figures for future capex.

nj6j6cy,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Looking into dividends as a stable income.,"Depending on your age and goals, I would keep an eye on total returns and have some level of NAV growth. Things like MSTY or others can have some nasty decline as it eats itself over time.

Also keep in mind your tax brackets and a roadmap how you 'grow into your income tax brackets'. Not all tickers pay equaly. Some are ordinary income, long term capital gains or return of capital. It helps to understand what they mean and how it fits into your plan.

I am still forming a plan myself and priortizing long term holding (in retirement next year) some ROC stocks will be on my immediate list such as (QQQI, SPYI, NXG) and probably add some others (AOD, WIMI, ASGI, IGA).

Not 100% sure if I am not pushing as hard on monthly income I could go for some hybrid div growth such as (DIVO, FDVV, VYMI, EFAS).

Bear in mind the market can crash and prepare for the worst if you are willing to hold even if it goes to half the value or income for a few years on a bad bear run. Keep some HYSA 1-3 years for yourself or an emegency (if not already).

But if you do not need the money right now? If not, I highly encourage going for broad markets unless you have a pick that continually beat the total returns market...and be careful trying to beat the market. I use VOO as a benchmark and compare the total returns / metrics per dollar invested and see if something is worth it to me.

Growth = wealth. If you’re not NEEDING the income now, then you need wealth. 

Compare SCHG to SCHD over the last 10 years. That 3.5% dividend yield is costing you a lot. SCHG would have 2.7x your money, SCHD would be 1.1x. 

If you are dead set on money now, F the rest, I’d suggest one of the index CC ETFs (JEP’s, GP’s, SPYI/QQQI, XDTE/RDTE/QDTE) or a basket holdings ETF (WPAY, YMAX, YMAG).

nj5zpe4,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Moving from Belgium to Prague — worth it for a family?,"Maybe look better at Czech supermarkets near border because it's funny that each side of border goes to the other side because something is always better/cheaper on the other side.

Sure if we are talking just about supermarkets you can generally find worse quality there but again it also depends. There are many of them and Globus, Albert, Lidl, Tesco, Penny or Billa can differ a lot. Especially Globus with own bakery (and I mean proper bakery not just reheated frozen semi-finished products) and butchery is on different level to the rest. Then you still have small bakeries, butchers that were not replaced by supermarkets that push more to low price than quality as well as small veggie shops and farmer markets that are not priced at premium.

I agree that quality of many products in big supermarket chains is worse but we have alternatives or Czechs generally cook or prepare lot of things at home which makes those ready-to-eat/semi-finished or highly processed foods rather a thing that is not good and they compete only with price to get it so low people stop making it at home but at the cost of quality. That's something that is hard to compere. I'd never buy sweets in supermarket but always in proper cukrárna or home made and this can often lead to impression that many products are just rubbish. They are but the market and competition is a bit different.",Qwe5Cz,1,,,2025-10-12 22:56:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/nj5zpe4/

1o5082b,post,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Looking into dividends as a stable income.,"So, I've taken an interest into dividends as a way of earning a stable income, perhaps as an additional income to any job that I have or will get.  
Current goal that I'm looking for is to at least get a $2000 monthly dividend income.  

I have currently invested $2k into some stocks (but will be getting additional funding to work for a dividend income).  
Current positions that I have:  
* BG  
* ADM  
* F  
* ADT  
* GNW  
* MSTY  
* VEGI  
* CTVA  
* SPYI  
* GRID  
Highest positions that i currently have are SPYI at 14 stocks and GRID at 10.  
  
My watchlist for Monthly ETF are:  
* SPYI  
* QQQI  
* IWMI  
* MSTY  
* ISPY  
* QDVO  
With SPYI, QQQI, and IWMI most likely going to be the majority of the monthly dividend income.  
  
I have some Weekly ETF's in a watchlist mainly for quick cash influx if needed but are mainly going to be suplemental and will be turned back into either a monthly or growth stock.  
Those are:  
* COIW  
* HOOW  
* PLTW  
* AVGW  
* AMDW  
* NVDW  
* MSTW  
  
As for normal etf watchlist, I have:  
* VYM  
* NOBL  
* SCHD  
* VIG  
* DGRO  
* PCH  

And long term watchlist:  
* KO  
* MMM  
* JNJ  
* PEP  
* VNOM  
* VTI  

Would like to hear some opinions as this is mainly a cursory glance that I had taken a look at on the subreddit.  
  
EDIT: Corrected some... mischaracterizations.  
EDIT2:  
I've narrowed down my list to currently 10 stocks ranging around 500 to 2000 shares.  
VYMI, AOD, VICI, IGA, EPD, SPYI, JEPQ, QQQI, QDVO, and IWMI.  
Hope this is a decent start with them.",alatnet,9,0.62,52.0,2025-10-12 22:44:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o5082b/looking_into_dividends_as_a_stable_income/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o5082b/looking_into_dividends_as_a_stable_income/
nj5vq0s,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Moving from Belgium to Prague — worth it for a family?,"About finances, I said they'd be fine even with the horrible quotes and cost estimations which are too high, but let's just say for sake of argument that the first year those costs are correct they'll still do very well, as I doubt they'd be able to live in BE on 1.5k a month to save another 1-1.5k.

But in the grocery topic; many in CZ say we are the trashcan of the rich Europe... It is known we get lesser goods and grocery quality. I'm often traveling in Poland and Germany, it is pretty damn obvious from the produce section. I know how to read product labels, but even the high end premium grocery stores don't sell much meat products with 90%+ meat in them. And they always highlight on the front that there is 85% maso (meat in Czech). While in Germany and Poland, many similar products highlight 90%+. And that's facts, no matter how you feel about it. Also go to the deli section of high end grocery stores like Kaufland or Tesco. If they even mark on the small signs the % of maso, it is usually between 60-80%. The ""best"" might have 85-90%, but that's the best you'll find. While in Germany and Poland, the deli section will be full of 90% meat markings. 

Produce is much the same. Many products are over ripe, fermenting or just look ugly (I know, deformed produce doesn't change quality, but I'm talking about damaged produce with visible markings from harvest machines, fall damage and more. Very rarely seen in the other countries mentioned). Many products come from ""inferior"" production countries, like tomatoes from Holland instead of Spain/Italy etc. Sure, the country location might be a choice by super markets due to the spending habits of the population, but it doesn't change the fact of what is available in the grocery stores in CZ.

Sure things have changed for the better, especially since Covid. But frequently (and quite recently) I compare groceries and products across the three countries Germany, Poland and Czechia, and consistently Czechia is worse. And an observation I have on this: we see Czechs going to both Germany and Poland border areas for lots of shopping. I've not seen any German or Polish who cross the border into Czechia to shop. And I have a chata (cabin) close to the Polish border, so I'm pretty sure about this part at least when it comes to the Polish and border shopping. So why if the grocery product quality and price are similar, would the Czechs practically be invading the Polish border area super markets?",Gardium90,1,,,2025-10-12 22:35:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/nj5vq0s/

Reinvested dividends are always taxable in the year they are received, regardless of whether you take them in cash or automatically reinvest them. The IRS treats reinvestment as if you received the dividend and then used it to buy more shares, making it taxable income.

Automating reinvestment simplifies management and ensures consistent capital deployment. BUT, if you have cash ready and Trump does his regular social truth post, you might be able to get a better dip.

Keeping idle cash in a HYSA is appropriate for emergency funds, but for long term growth, dividend ETFs are superior.

Day traders often do price scalping on the scale of literal seconds or minutes. Where someone will be in and out of a trade within a few minutes at most. Here I was referring to price scalping intraday on SPX, where it's usually at least a few minutes. For example if you see price approaching a key level and you're watching for a reversal, you may enter a trade to make a quick profit off the bounce, and exit in majority or in full once the bounce starts to lose momentum. Generally if I do 0DTE price scalping my trades will last 5-30 minutes, and the longer trades generally only run longer if they are profitable and I'm trailing a stop loss up to key levels or something.",wentwj,4,,,2025-10-12 21:00:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o3pmnq/to_people_who_made_millions_on_spy_0dte_puts_today/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o3pmnq/to_people_who_made_millions_on_spy_0dte_puts_today/nj5cua3/

China is willing to take the massive hit on complete decoupling with the US now and wait it out because it sees trade with the Global South as a now viable alternative. So yes, it will hurt them, but they will live. 
  
China has a long tradition in asymmetric warfare (e.g. Mao practised guerrilla warfare during WW2). So it will only fight the US close to its own shores. US definitely can't be sure of victory fighting in China's home turf. Remember, the US can't build F-35 or warships entirely domestically (parts of the jet are built in the EU, Japan) to replace war losses because we hollowed out our industrial base over the past 40 years with deliberate, relentless outsourcing.

nj57hg4,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,S&P 500 vs FTSE All-World — which do you prefer and why?,"I'm 100% S&P 500.

I'm well aware that the most optimal portfolio should be diversified across multiple regions, multiple sectors and also multiple asset classes as well. In that regards, not even a 100% VWCE portfolio should be considered safe, because it's still 100% equities. If you're doing anything other than the three-fund portfolio, you're taking a bet. A bet on a certain region, sector or asset class outperforming the rest.

I've spent a ridiculous amount of time backtesting various timespans. I'm aware of the fact that (for example) between 1970 and 1990, the global market outperformed the S&P 500 by quite a big amount, so the US isn't a constant winner. However, I personally still believe that the US's dominance of the past 15 years isn't close to being over yet, so I'm taking a bet on it. If I see the situation changing in the future, I'll change my portfolio as well. But for now, I'll stick to the S&P 500.

And yes, ""past performance doesn't guarantee future results"", but that's true for asset classes as well. Nothing guarantees that equities will outperform bonds in the next decade, so even 100% VWCE is ""taking a bet"" in that sense.

When others ask for my advice, I recommend them the three-fund portfolio.

Rare earth elements (REE) are not rare at all. But REE are REALLY hard to separate chemically (e.g. centrifuge won't work due to similar mass/density).
  
The hard part is the refinement infrastructure (huge investment with low margin return for years), and it took China approximately 20 years to build up the infrastructure to where they are today.  
  
So no, the EU + US are years, if not decades, behind in REE refinement. Our greedy govt + corporations screwed over the US' REE independence due to sheer myopic drive for margin.
  
Comments about REE consumption reduction is literally unfeasible. Each F-35 has 900lbs of REE. 900lbs ! And that's just F35.   
  
How about Tomahawks or the new Virginia-class subs? Military drones (UAV) all of them use high-end neodymium magnet motors that's all REE. Of course, if we allocate all the REE to military, then we can forget things like EV, indutrial robots, civilian drones, medical equipment, etc.

1o4waq2,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,$CRSR Corsair Gaming Analysis,"This was another bad year for the stock. Early 2025, the founder Andy Paul retired as CEO just before new tariffs hit. Stock fell to book value in April. Since then, the company revealed that tariff impacts were far less severe than feared. Less than 19% of revenue is from China-sourced products and PC components are exempt from tariffs now. The new CEO began executing a sharper, more innovation-led strategy that could turn the course.

Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Technology Conference the CEO revealed her vision: a company that’s not just riding hardware cycles but actively building an ecosystem that can transcend them. Her focus on accelerating product cadence, deepening integration across product segments, and unlocking new markets (like simulation hardware) seems to be working.

![img](by8kz7z4zmuf1)

Corsair operates in two main segments: Gamer/Creator Peripherals and Gaming Components/Systems. These products are commodity-like, but they are increasingly being tied together through Corsair’s blend of this hardware with their software, iCUE (soon to be replaced by Web Hub, more on this later). It provides seamless integration across a wide range of Corsair and third-party products. It allows users to control lighting, fan speeds, monitor system health, and stream overlays from a unified interface.

This increasingly software-enabled hardware ecosystem creates real switching costs. As customers invest in multiple Corsair and non-Corsair devices that are integrated via iCUE, they become locked in by the convenience and performance of the integrated hardware-software experience. In a space where hardware alone is rarely differentiated, software-driven cohesion could become Corsair’s moat.

Corsair had low margins, limited pricing power, and a lack of defensible moat. On top of this, PC and gaming hardware are exposed to cyclical volatility. But that is the Corsair of yesterday.

While stock-based compensation and amortization from acquisitions continued to weigh on GAAP profitability, free cash flow and revenue have improved significantly year-over-year. Net income remains volatile, but importantly, Corsair is beginning to generate investable profits from its higher-growth business lines, which management has said will be reinvested to develop high-margin, differentiated products. Furthermore, intangible losses and increased free cash flow have turned more of the company’s book-value into cash. That means firmer footing for its stock.

Q2 2025 and Ecosystem Expansion

Q2 2025 marked a critical turning point. Revenue benefited from strong product launches by NVIDIA and AMD, signaling the beginning of a new PC gaming upgrade cycle. This should be bigger and longer than before, because there is additional demand from Local Large Language Model enthusiasts who build PCs for AI purposes. Corsair’s performance closely tracks these third-party cycles, which is risky when you have no moat and low margins. Regardless, the company executed well in Q2.

The memory segment saw double-digit growth, although intense competition kept margins in check. Fortunately, Corsair’s scale helped it retain some leverage over suppliers, especially in a weak pricing environment.

Peripherals, Corsair’s most strategically important segment, grew 9% YoY. This might seem modest, but Corsair captured share in keyboards and headsets, and began rolling out its Fanatec racing rig, a turnkey experience that’s difficult for competitors to replicate quickly.

Importantly, growth in this segment isn’t hostage to supplier pricing power. With Elgato positioned to benefit from the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 launch and possibly even TikTok Live's surging popularity, this part of the business could become a key driver in upcoming quarters.

At the end of Q2, Corsair launched Corsair Web Hub to replace their troubled iCUE configuration software. The new web browser based system eliminates all of the problems iCUE had with software updates, boot compatibility, and cross-program interference. A major pain point for customers, this issue alone impacted brand loyalty and customer retention for years.

I've never had a problem with iCUE, but a lot of gamers have complex boot and update settings, or use MacOS. Now it is neatly contained in the web browser. Older products will be on-boarded to the Web Hub and increase customer satisfaction immediately. Such dramatic improvement in their core strategic asset accelerates Corsair’s path to become a hardware-software ecosystem.

Corsair currently upsells Elgato customers a Pro-version of the Elgato Stream Deck app and the Elgato Marketplace allow purchases and trading of digital gadgets that enhance Elgato hardware. This model could be brought to the iCUE or Web Hub experience, as the company releases more software-enriched products at a higher cadence. It would add a recurring, SAAS revenue stream layer across all of Corsair’s physical products.

The most exciting product launch just happened quietly at the end of August. Corsair launched the XENEON EDGE 14.5"" LCD Touchscreen. Initially met with skepticism, it sold out within 10 hours.

Priced at $250, this device appears to carry healthy margins and, crucially, faces no direct competition yet. This launch may be the first proof point in the CEO’s promise to deliver more frequent, innovative, high-quality products. If Corsair can maintain this pace of innovation, it could significantly alter how the market views the company’s long-term potential.

They also released a curved glass case that has iCUE-enabled fans included. Normally the fans were sold separately so gamers would opt for non-iCUE fans. As they tie more products together like this, it'll help strengthen the ecosystem.

Corsair’s acquisition of Fanatec is already paying dividends. The CEO has outlined a bold vision to expand beyond racing simulation into higher-margin simulation verticals such as golf, where hardware and software can deliver immersive experiences.

NVIDIA and AMD GPUs can now run Large Language Models locally (without the nanny restrictions of cloud based LLMs). Check r/LocalLLaMA to gauge the interest there. DDR memory prices have surged significantly in Q3, as consumer demand for Local Large Language Model-enabled PCs takes off. 

Since this surge is driven by consumer demand (not supply constraints on PC ram memory) Corsair stands to benefit from this surge. Furthermore, since this surge is likely to produce actual utility for the consumers experimenting with this technology, it could broaden further and shift the secular demand trend to benefit Corsair for several years.

![img](bj129qq12nuf1)

![img](wponwhe62nuf1)

Typically, memory cycles don't favor Corsair margins much. However, during COVID, the cycle was driven by consumer demand and Corsair had great margins in that cycle. This cycle is also shaping up to be that way with the addition of the Local LLM trend. If you combine these tailwinds in gaming hardware with long-awaited game launches, and Local LLMs the company is well-positioned to benefit from overlapping cycles.

B. Riley recently took the stock down by erroneously declaring 2026 as a console year, meaning customers would focus budgets on consoles instead of PCs. There are no major console releases expected in 2026. Also, consoles in general have tariffs whereas PC components are exempt. The new CEO's strategy is working and secular demand continues to rise. 

Despite past concerns around margins and moat, the company’s recent cash flow efficiency and clear strategic direction suggest that its potential as a hardware-software ecosystem leader for gamers and creators is underpriced.",moazzam0,1,0.52,22.0,2025-10-12 20:13:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4waq2/crsr_corsair_gaming_analysis/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4waq2/crsr_corsair_gaming_analysis/

nj4xc9u,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How do I maximize return on my emergency fund?,"So we’re actually saying the same thing, but you’re missing something:

I’m not “assuming” folks are 100% invested. I replied to a comment about someone not having an emergency fund, and instead being 100% invested.

Context is important.

And your “balanced fund” idea does mitigate risk (assuming some of that fund is cash/bonds or equivalent). However, it doesn’t give you the flexibility of setting your own allocations. You’re basically saying “take half of your emergency cash and put it in a fund that is 20% cash and 80% stocks” (or whatever the allocation is). It’s not wrong, but if things get as bad as they have historically, it does introduce additional risk because you can’t withdraw the cash portion separately. But if you understand that and sleep well at night, then you’ve served the purpose of an emergency fund.",rickochetl,1,,,2025-10-12 19:42:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o48vxi/how_do_i_maximize_return_on_my_emergency_fund/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o48vxi/how_do_i_maximize_return_on_my_emergency_fund/nj4xc9u/

1o4vdyj,post,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I need to consult the dividend experts here.,"I (M26) inherited 100k in an investment account in April of this year after my grandmother passed. My dad passed a few years ago, so my brother and I received what would have been his share, amongst his siblings. I also invested 30k of what I earned from the selling of her house. In total I have 130k invested. The portfolio I inherited had a lot of low movement stocks, things such as Dupont, Duke Energy, Chemours, etc. It's clear this was a dividend focused portfolio for my grandparents to receive monthly income. After doing some research and learning about the stepped-up cost basis on inherited portfolios, to figure out what I would be taxed for, I learned that I would only be taxed for capital gains earned since I've owned it. Some of these stocks were in the green but many were in the deep red. 

My goal as of now is to focus on growth oriented stocks, and seeing as my grandparents were getting 800 a month in dividends, I reallocated much to etfs and stocks that aligned more with my current goal. However I still allocated 10% toward dividend earners (SCHD, VIG, O) still netting me a projected 1,300 a year. 

Given that I am holding these dividend stocks in a taxable brokerage account and I am drip feeding the payouts back into the stock, is it worth to hold on to this much right now. I'm younger and in a lower tax bracket, but my plan to continue to drip feed the dividend payouts back into the stock for while and then possibly in my mid 30's use it as supplemental income. Is that a feasible plan.   
I also am keeping some of my inheritance in a HYSA, would it be simpler to put that money in there?

My main concern is the tax implications of these investments, as I know many people my age get taken by the passive income idea. I just want to make sure I know all the in's and out's and won't be taxed out the wazoo during this stage in my life. I'm just looking at it as something to supplement my income down the line, like I said, it's only 10% of my portfolio. I'm aware of the Roth IRA route, but that ties it up until I'm 59 1/2.   
Any tips or advice would be appreciated!",heylookitsconnor,12,0.75,27.0,2025-10-12 19:38:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o4vdyj/i_need_to_consult_the_dividend_experts_here/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o4vdyj/i_need_to_consult_the_dividend_experts_here/
nj4w5lk,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,16 with a Fidelity acc (advice needed!),"Here's a plot of the total return of an investment over 15 years on an inflation adjusted basis. It's a particularly good illustration because there was a large stock market drop that happened shortly after this period started:

https://totalrealreturns.com/s/VTI,VDIGX,VT,BND,VFISX

If you bought VTI (US domestic) or VT (US + world), the resale value would have dropped substantially in the first year, but that doesn't matter over the long term, as you are investing in companies that are growing their earnings every year. It will eventually recover as shown here. Note how the intermediate term bond fund barely keeps pace with inflation, and the short term bond fund lost value.

As long as you don't need this money currently for your own survival, investing it at leaving it invested no matter what the stock market does from day to day is the strategy that will build you wealth.

As a dividend stock investment, VT currently pays 1.7%, but that dividend per share amount grows at 7-8% per year. In 15 years, your $500 investment will be effectively earning 4.6-5.3% just off the dividend component. Those dividends will get reinvested into more shares of the ETF, too (all factoring into the total return).

There is a high likelihood that the resale value of your investment could drop substantially over the short term, but don't let that discourage you. Just keep buying consistently.",NotEasyBeingGreener,2,,,2025-10-12 19:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o4ogd5/16_with_a_fidelity_acc_advice_needed/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o4ogd5/16_with_a_fidelity_acc_advice_needed/nj4w5lk/

1o4v5ot,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Monday Game Plan for Option Sellers After Friday’s Sell-Off,"Happy Sunday everyone! Thought of doing some research today on what the potential scenarios could be for tomorrow, especially after a free-fall Friday.

Looking at the NASDAQ Composite, it is currently at 22,204 with support at 22,200. So there isn’t too much wiggle room to work with.

1. If the market opens with a gap down tomorrow, there is no real support until 22,060 - we can expect the market to touch those levels. Better supports are around the 21,885 and then 21,785 levels.
2. If the market opens stable around the 22,200 level, then we may expect the price to hold and possibly attempt to move up. However, after such a big fall, a sudden recovery is unlikely, and the market should remain volatile but relatively flat.
3. If the market opens with a gap up - markets may remain uncertain and try to establish new support levels before any decisive move.

**My advice for option sellers:**

1. Check your margin balances if you’re using a margin account. If the market dips further, margin calls may be issued, and brokers might liquidate positions at bad prices. That’s never a good feeling. Keep some liquid cash at hand. If a margin call isn’t triggered, this is a good time to open CSPs since premiums are really attractive right now - just remember that assignment risk is higher in volatile markets.
2. I would advise not to rely solely on delta now, as high volatility can make deltas move quickly and change probabilities fast. Instead, focus on price action. Check which shares you would be comfortable owning at a good price. With the market sell-off on Friday, a lot of quality stocks may have broken supports - and when the market recovers, these shares could regain lost ground quite fast. Opening ITM puts can yield higher premiums if you truly want to own the shares.
3. For covered calls, it’s a good time to close existing positions. I usually close when I’ve captured 80-85% of the premium, but everyone has their own preferences. It’s also a good time to roll down or roll out if that’s part of your approach.

This is just my current read on the market based on the data and price action - things can always play out differently, but this is how I’m positioning myself going into Monday. Would love to hear your thoughts and insights too - always happy to learn from how others are approaching it.

1o4ufmv,post,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?

I get it.

Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?

Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?

Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.

But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.

First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.

Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.

Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.

I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.

Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.

""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""

AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.""

Who am I to argue with Su, who may go down as one of the best tech CEOs of all time? What she has done at AMD since joining in 2012 is mind-blowing.

Lastly, let's talk about AI worrywarts' warning calls about valuations.

According to new research out of Goldman Sachs this week, the median forward P/E ratio across the ""Magnificent Seven"" is 27 times, or 26 times if excluding Tesla (TSLA), which has a much higher multiple than the other companies. This is roughly half the equivalent valuation of the biggest seven companies in the late 1990s, and the dominant companies in Japan (mostly banks) traded at higher valuations still.

What's more, the current enterprise-to-sales ratios are also much lower than those of the dominant companies in the late 1990s.

""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" said Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

I couldn't agree more, Peter.",TylerDurdenEsq,174,0.76,181.0,2025-10-12 19:02:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/

If you think everybody around you treat you badly then the problem is probably at your side you just don't want to admit it. Your attitude is extremely rude and disrespectful towards locals and since Czechs are direct and straightforward without sugarcoating things, they will mirror your hostile approach to them perfectly. I'm sure with that.

Czechs don't care about your financial situation, that's very American thing. It's pretty normal that you join your friends in past time activities or a glass of beer and they all can have very different income. But If you feel Westerners are something better and act like that I'm sure people can sense it very well because that's exactly how tourists behave. No knowledge about our history, no understanding of our culture, just moving in for cheaper and safer life preferably with western income.

Food quality is not low. You just need to read the ingredients on the item listed in Czech and don't buy the cheapest supermarket stuff. You can easily find good quality and not premium priced products. There are still reasonably priced small butchers, bakeries, patisseries, farmers' markets etc.

nj4jl15,comment,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"People can talk all they want about Lynas this or Mountain Pass that. Here's what those companies have to say:

Lynas 2024 Annual Report. ""The Company continues to investigate opportunities to secure alternative sources of Heavy Rare Earth feedstock. However, global availability is limited, with most supply originating from ionic clay deposits in China and Myanmar.""

MP Materials 2024 Annual Report: ""While the Mount Pass facility produces separated Light Rare Earth products such as NdPr, our planned Heavy Rare Earth separation capabilities will still depend on feedstock imports. Current non-Chinese supply is negligible, making global heavy rare earth supply chains highly vulnerable to geopolitical risk.""

Once the focus shifts from all rare earths to just the HREEs, China's position morphs from temporarily dominant to near-absolute monopoly, accounting for more than 98% of global extraction if Myanmar is included and a near equivalent share of separation capacity. This is not a market distortion that can be easily fixed by building more processing plants in the
West. Without viable deposits, investment in processing is somewhat irrelevant. In this sense, Deng Xiaoping's remarks understate the level of control and dominance that China has over the rare earths that matter. The only other known material sources of HREEs sits in regions bordering China in Myanmar, which holds 10-15% of known global HREE reserves (and all of their output is processed in China). There is no clear historical precedent for this scale of control over a strategic asset. A few examples that come to mind are De Beer's control of the diamond trade in the 20th century or Sudan's control over Gum Arabic, a key input for soft drinks-but neither commodity has anything approaching the same strategic or geopolitical value.

China is also probably worried about growing tensions coupled with this administrations goal of building western supply chains on rare earth elements and critical minerals.

This hurts Americans and American companies more and first, vs China -- No one wins in a trade war, but it will hurt the American consumer, businesses, and manufacturers much more. China (they have many of their own issues) but has a centrally planned economy, and China sells to the REST of the world. China is also making SEA its own mini version of China because it can now manufacture and ships from there cheaply. China has been busy since 2016 removing all its supply chains away from the US. The Chinese Soy business is not coming back to America, and the Cotton business is not coming back to America.

Private credit bros and banks got roasted Jefferies, UBS linked funds, BlackRock and others named as creditors and staring at billions of potential losses.


Debt was both on the books and hidden off the books in invoice finance traps; lenders later found the same invoices pledged to multiple parties.

Court filings say up to $2.3B vanished and the company had under $30M cash when it folded.


Private credit’s lack of transparency turned this from a corporate bankruptcy into a Wall Street embarrassment.




Enter AI: 

Anthropic and OpenAI sit private and thirsty for capital, able to sip the same private-credit punch that fueled First Brands, insulating them from public scrutiny while amplifying leverage flowing into the AI hype cycle.


Nvidia sits at the center of the loop chips fuel models, PE/private-credit fuels models, and model winners feed back into Nvidia demand; the result is a circular money flow where ever-higher GPU bets are collateral for more private credit.


If private credit rehypothecation and invoice-style double counting are anywhere near systemic, the unwind could cascade: credit freezes, asset fire sales, AI valuations collapsing, Nvidia multiples re-rating, and a market liquidity spiral.


Doomsday take: by year-end the unwind accelerates, private-credit markdowns trigger margin calls, public and private AI froth evaporates, and the market suffers a brutal reset that drags banks, hedge funds and even the big AI plays into a vicious ",hhh888hhhh,0,0.28,11.0,2025-10-12 18:26:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4ti0u/ai_bubble_slowly_started_popping_last_week_when/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4ti0u/ai_bubble_slowly_started_popping_last_week_when/

I have been researching dozens of these etf to find the best one. 

DIVO buys individual SP500 component stocks and uses covered calls tactically. annual dividend yield is around 4.5%

DIVO was created in 2016 and has the best track record, in 2022 when SP500 dropped -18% and QQQ fell -32%, DIVO only had small drop -1.49%. 

That to me is just incredible.

This year DIVO had a total return drawdown of -7% ytd when QQQ had fallen -20% in April and SP500 was down  -18%

To me its proof that DIVO fund manager knows what they are doing.

DIVO has had an average annual return of 12.38%. 
This is very good return for its much lower volatility

Their fund manager is clearly very good, they invest in sp500 individual stocks and use options to protect their position

No other fund I can find that has produced 12% average annual return over the past nearly 10 years, while only dropping a few percent in total returns at the same time that QQQ or SP500 has fallen 15% or more in a year.

The proper play would have been to incentivize or subsidize manufacturing in the US, so that the US would actually be able to make higher quality good at cheaper prices that could compete without screwing over trade relations and international affairs.

Resorting to tarriffs is almost like an admission of not being able to create higher quality and cheaper goods in the US compared to other countries to be able to compete in a free global market. So of course, other countries have also started to not buy US goods since the US is signalling it isn't willing to participate in global trade; overall, instead of competing, we've resorted to what is basically bullying - and the world isn't taking kindly to it, even the EU (China's exports actually increased since US tarrifs because other countries, including ones in the EU bought more Chinese goods).",DoNotNoticeMePlz,4,,,2025-10-12 18:18:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o4qj1w/trump_will_surrender_face_to_china_again/,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o4qj1w/trump_will_surrender_face_to_china_again/nj4gfuz/

1o4sjzh,post,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"Week Recap: Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. The stock market tumbled. We've seen this before. Will the rally continue? Oct. 6, 2025 – Oct. 10, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from October 3 to October 10.

Last week, the stock market completed a fully green week, but the gains were limited to around 0.5%. This week had some losing days, but they were still limited expect for Friday. The most important topic of 2025 came out again: Tariffs.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

September 12 close at 6,584.29 - September 19 close at 6,664.39 🟢 (+1.22%)

September 19 close at 6,664.39 - September 26 close at 6,643.70 🔴 (-0.31%)

September 26 close at 6,643.70 - October 3 close at 6,715.79 🟢 (+1.09%)

October 3 close at 6,715.79 - October 10 close at 6,552.50 🔴 (-2.43%)

🔸 Monday: Trump said the stock market continually hit records highs. He's right. Many data releases were delayed or cancelled which helped the stock market. Volatility was lower. On the other hand, Gold and Silver continued to rise. The White House's Hassett said layoffs will come if Trump thinks shutdown negotiations 'are going nowhere'. The Dollar Index started rising from 97.5. The stock market opened higher. During the session, Trump announced all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported will be tariffed 25%. It was the first attempt for tariffs, but the stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The Senate rejected Republican spending bill to end government shutdown. The stock market opened slightly higher. Precious metals have been very popular for a while and Goldman Sachs lifted its gold price target to $4,900 for 2026 year-end. The S&P 500 declined from 6,750 and pulled back. The stock market closed lower. The S&P 500 broken 7-day winning streak. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Gold rose above $4,000 for the first time in history. The stock market opened higher. Fed minutes were released and the stock market expects 2 more rate cut by the end of 2025. Next meeting will be October 29. CME FedWatch tool is showing 98% possibility of 25 point rate cut in October. The stock market closed higher. Nasdaq closed above 23,000 for the first time ever. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Silver gained more than 3.5% and surpassed $51. $49,81 was the highest since 2011. Thus, it surpassed. Israel and Hamas agreed on 'first phase' of Gaza ceasefire. The stock market opened higher. The Dollar Index continued rising and completed 4-day winning streak. It reached 99.50. As a result, Gold and Silver could not hold their gains. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Fed Governor Waller sees more rate cuts but central bank needs to be ""cautious about it"". Gold and Silver rebounded after Thursday’s loses. The stock market opened higher. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary came at 4.6% that slightly lower than last month's 4.7%, but it wasn't the focus for today because Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. Oil felt more than 4%. The stock market closed under heavy selling pressure. The S&P 500 felt more than 2.5% and Nasdaq dropped more than 3.5%. 🔴

The stock market continued to rise slowly while the government remaining closed. We did not see any labor market data, so the stock market could not get information from reports. The S&P 500 dropped more than 2.5% in a single day, but volume was only slightly above 20-day moving average. The stock market had made all-time high after another. I believe that we don't need to make any panic yet. We've seen this before.

That being said, the whole ""return to the norm"" to me is nonsense. The US has dominated the rest of the world in recent years because companies that are changing the world were born there, thanks to the capital and talent available.

It did not happen by chance or because the roulette went on a hot streak of 10 red numbers in a row.

If Europe keeps falling behind - and I say that as a European myself - the gap will keep widening. There is not ""reversion to the mean"" by default; it is just a product of what happens in terms of innovation and investments.

They have more VC capital, more talent, more entrepreneurial initiative, and a better ecosystem when it comes to investing and innovating.

Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas le sujet, il faut savoir que Google donne des millions par an aux sociétés de presse pour avoir le droit de reprendre les liens des articles de journaux sur Google Actualités (et sans doute ailleurs aussi).

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop. 

Just an example : EU can't find Germanium for their defense sector

On any up swing my hi Beta stocks jump and outperform the loss on the VXX. I trim the stock positions or hedge at extremes of the vol bands so on a down swing I am less long and re load same or other symbols that give better entry signals.

Dollar cost average half your cash into a balanced fund over the next 12-24 months.    We're talking just a couple/few hundred bucks a month or so.   Leave the rest of your cash in a savings account.   Once you have half of your emergency fund in the balanced fund, then invest the monthly interest from your cash into the balanced fund forever.  This strategy will increase the rate of return on your money substantially.",TN_REDDIT,-1,,,2025-10-12 14:03:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o48vxi/how_do_i_maximize_return_on_my_emergency_fund/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o48vxi/how_do_i_maximize_return_on_my_emergency_fund/nj397m2/

Perso, pour deux raisons :

1. La gestion des onglets lorsqu'il y en a de nombreux d'ouverts. Firefox cache les premiers. De plus, leur taille minimale est beaucoup plus élevée que sur Chrome, ce qui fait qu'on ne peut pas en ouvrir autant que sur les navigateurs de type chromium avant que cet antipattern de masquage d'onglets ne se déclenche. De mémoire, ça se règle dans les paramètres, mais on ne peut pas descendre plus bas qu'à peu près du double de la taille minimale des onglets sur Chrome.

2. Il faut migrer toutes les extensions qui rendent un navigateur à peu près commode à utiliser, ce qui est pas forcément possible. Il faut aussi migrer les scripts Tampermonkey, et, pour cela, il faut du temps et des compétences qu'on a pas/plus forcément.

Franchement et sans déconner, j'ai plus de mal à passer de Chromium à Firefox que je n'en ai eu de passer de W10 à Linux Mint.",TrueRignak,-9,,,2025-10-12 13:26:36,https://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/2035525/les-francais-n-ont-pas-acces-au-meme-google-que-les-utilisateurs-du-reste-du-monde.htm,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o4kqul/les_français_nont_pas_accès_au_même_google_que/nj34rz7/

1o4l857,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Inflation-linked Bonds,"Sorry for the basic question, I'm new to investing. 

In Ireland as a resident (who lives there), but not domiciled (not planning to stay there), if you have your money at a foreign broker, as long as you don't touch ETFs or funds, you only pay taxes upon remittance (when you send your money from your broker to your (Irish/EU?) bank account, as it is treated as foreign investment). So I was thinking of investing some of my income only in stocks and bond while I'm living there for 3-5 years. Later I would sell everything  (but keep the cash at the broker) when I'm about to leave (to avoid problems with my new country about what are founds and what are profits). 

  
I doubt that I could sufficiently diversify my stock portfolio to even approximate ETFs, and I'm also a bit pessimistic about the future,  and my number one goal is just to beat inflation, so I was thinking of investing in inflation-linked bonds. I would put maybe about 30% of my money in them. 

So what are my options? is this a good plan? If I open a Degiro account are these available? I have seen that Germany stopped issuing such  [bonds](https://www.deutsche-finanzagentur.de/en/federal-securities/types-of-federal-securities/inflation-linked-federal-securities),  what is the reason for that?

1o4kmly,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Investing for 5 years,"Hey everyone!

Throwaway account for privacy reason.

I turned 18 recently, and I have been thinking about investing for a little while now.

A lot of advice is VWCE and chill, which I want to do, but it doesn't seem like the best option for me.

I have roughly a grand saved up, of which I want to keep a few hundred euros in case I need it.

I currently have some issues with the long term commitment of VWCE. I might need the money for a house in 6 years, or some other big expenses. Commiting the money for 10+ years doesn't sound comfortable.

I could keep the money in a bank account, but the interest is very low (1.25), so that doesn't sound like a great option either.

What are my options in terms of short term investments? I will definitely invest some money in VWCE, but it can't be a lot. 

Are fixed term bond etfs a good option? Maybe something like iShares iBonds? Are there any other short term investments I'm missing?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",HeavySelection9507,0,0.5,5.0,2025-10-12 11:25:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o4kmly/investing_for_5_years/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o4kmly/investing_for_5_years/

Do you have a good life in Belgium already, family or personal networks who you can rely on? Same question for Prague. And most importantly which languages do you speak? These are far bigger factors, because navigating hospitals, bureaucracy and then schooling without a network or language can be really isolating.

nj2eo5d,comment,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Buy NVDA or NBIS?,"I think $NVDA has a great chance of 3x by 2030, which would land it around $15 market cap.  That is lower than the 10x you are looking for.  However a 3x would be sizable especially considering the nature of the underlying asset.  While that seems like an extreme market cap, more and more sectors of the economy are being revolutionized by AI.  Medical records are now written by AI.  Financial investment apps have AI assistants now to help investors make trading and long term financial decisions.  And this is just the web based AI. Once AI brains are placed in robots, even more of the economy becomes dependent on chips, which all leads back to Nvidia.  With $NVDA too, its dividend will grow over time making holding it in your portfolio even more profitable over long periods of time. Right now the dividend isn’t much, but the dividend growth rate should mean that the dividend increases over time to amplify returns from $NVDA.  $NBIS does not currently have a dividend, though this could change as it becomes highly profitable.

$NBIS is a good bet for a longer term timescale, more like 10 years to 10x due to the time it will take to generate profits with high capex costs up front.  

In sum, both companies are a good investment, but the right decision depends on what you are looking for in your investments, including growth, income, the time scale for your returns, and your risk tolerance.",ThyArtIsJulia,1,,,2025-10-12 08:59:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4br1p/buy_nvda_or_nbis/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4br1p/buy_nvda_or_nbis/nj2eo5d/

nj24cx4,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,S&P 500 vs FTSE All-World — which do you prefer and why?,"Unlike the cult-minded VWCE followers who seem to dominate this sub, I would definitely pick the S&P 500. 

Yes, America is fucked up, but that doesn’t mean their stock market isn’t going to continue to rise.
Their economy is the one that most centred around growth in the stock market especially in comparison to Europe. And the biggest and most profitable companies are mostly from the US.

Also the FTSE All World is completely over-diversified. Instead of investing in the 50, 100 or 500 best companies, it invests in over 4000 (was it that figure?) companies which inevitably includes loads of mediocre or even subpar companies I would never want to invest in.

So if you like gains and don’t mind putting a little extra thought into your investment, I would recommend *not* buying the FTSE All World.",TASC2000,0,,,2025-10-12 07:18:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o3xom5/sp_500_vs_ftse_allworld_which_do_you_prefer_and/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o3xom5/sp_500_vs_ftse_allworld_which_do_you_prefer_and/nj24cx4/

nj1zqut,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How do I maximize return on my emergency fund?,"Buy a mix of treasury etfs ranging from the short term stuff out to the really long term stuff. Set the dividends to drip. 

With a mix you should get a decent return and the risk of the etf price going up or down substantially is there, but not that bad. As the price drops you will likely get a higher yield and if the price spikes you will get a lower yield. 

Over time your share count in all of them should increase which should keep the buying power of your emergency fund growing. You will have taxes from this though, but I wouldn't sweat that too much.

If you ever need funds you will need to sell some shares for cash and then transfer this over to your checking account. that can take several days so in my case I keep my checking account at a slightly higher level than many people do.

The second best way is just to let it sit in a money market fund. The Interest rate will be slightly lower but you be able to access it IMMEDIATELY using a debit card or check.


But an emergency fund is not intended to be an investment, but at least a money market fund or a high yield online savings account (interest rates are not as guaranteed) should keep up with inflation.",Far_Lifeguard_5027,1,,,2025-10-12 06:26:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o48vxi/how_do_i_maximize_return_on_my_emergency_fund/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o48vxi/how_do_i_maximize_return_on_my_emergency_fund/nj1y7s6/

nj1gfra,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Do y'all think this is just a repeat of April?,"Both countries need global trade to thrive. Both countries have leverage on the other but the value of that leverage is in dispute. 

Globalization is good for both countries. Deglobalization is bad for both countries. Who benefited more with global trade is debatable, but it is clear that while there were winners in both countries there were also losers. Rather than fix the issues its been easier for leaders in both countries to find someone to blame. In China they are blaming the foreign companies and the ceos of the domestic companies who did shady things. In the US leaders are blaming the other party and previous party leaders for how things have gone as well as foreign trade. 

The losers in the US were working class who got low cost but decent goods while losing high paying jobs. In and of itself that wouldn't have been the end of the world, but the cost of housing and a bunch of other stuff went up and up over time while their wages did not. They are rightfully upset over that and Trump stepped up to be their champion. He is probably going to win back a bunch of jobs for some industries in this crusade but cost a bunch of other jobs with the net impact being negative to neutral at best. During that time the cost of goods will spike and then likely the goods will simply vanish from shelves with the quality of life plunging as a result. I think the jobs losses might be bad enough to actually cause actual deflation, but we shall see. 

The losers in China were the workers who got screwed with their housing schemes and terrible work conditions in many of the factories. Now they have massive debt, incomplete houses, and in many cases no jobs. 

The truth is that both countries should have subsidized some portion of their economy to deal with the injustices global trade was bringing about. 

If the US had spent the past 50 years making everyone in high school learn a decent amount of one trade or another we probably could have kept housing costs low. Many would not have pursued those trades, but enough would that we would likely have the labor force with the skills and temperament to make the labor costs relatively low. Additionally the cheap financing of the mortgages doesnt help. If people have low pay but low expenses they dont bitch. If they have low pay and high expenses they do. Fixing that could have been as simple as capping the dollar amount for federally backed mortgages with it increasing at the rate of inflation. Instead we ended up in a situation like much of the developed world where housing relative to pay is severely above the level it was back in the 1940s-1970s. Fixing that would go a long ways towards making the situation tolerable for the less fortunate people in America. 

I dont know enough about the Chinese situation, but I would hazard they should have ended the 1 child policy much sooner or never implemented it and they should have done more to ease the path for the average citizen in their attempt to build a family and home.

End of the day this mess was created over decades and fixing it will take just as long.

I’ve thought about buying some just because I don’t have a lot of BDC exposure currently and they have such a solid historical track record with their dividend payments through all sorts of different market conditions, even the 2008 crash.

Sounds like a good buying opportunity as rates go down though.

It’d take more than a 15% drop to scare me off of a company with their track record. Especially if I were DCAing in as rates fall.

No.  You don't look to maximize returns on emergency funds.  You look for ways to protect your principle, mainly from inflation erosion.  
  
> With interest rates so low for most savings accounts with major banks, what are people doing to grow their emergency fund?  
  
No.  Interest rates are only low in traditional savings accounts, as they've usually been.  CDs, Bonds, HYSA, and Money Markets all offer a reasonable rate of return right now, while offering you protection to that principle.  
  
> It feels wasteful to have it sitting in the bank, but I need it to remain accessible in case of emergency, hence why I can’t lock it up in the stock market or a GIC.  
  
Yes, kinda... but no.  It would be wasteful to leave the bulk of your emergency fund in a traditional savings account.  It is unlikely you'll experience an emergency of such magnitude that you need 3-6 months of spend that is liquid right this second.  
  
I'm not a high income earner, and I live a LCOL lifestyle.  Personally, I'll keep $1,000 to $1,500 in my traditional savings account.  That is more than ample immediate liquidity.  
 
I keep it pretty simple from there.  CD ladder and HYSA.  I can transfer money from the HYSA in 3ish business days.

You are probably not gonna lose 100% of your shares. That's an important distinction. And I've done it, with massive amounts of money...even now lol. But I made big swings too. And I have an unhealthy level of risk tolerance probably. Not just here. I've lost over 100k in options premiums this year. And slept fine on those bad days. I'm just saying I know it's statistically improbable that you have that same temperament. And not sleeping well after that leads to more bad decisions, health issues, redheads, horrifying things.

And still the best decision I ever made was 2300 bucks in 2017. And I held those shares through every sell off. I looked at the argument to sell, and the argument to hold, not the non-specific soundbites about time in the market. I picked what seemed like the stronger argument. That eventually became 600 some odd shares of NVDA. and I had more, but that was the 2300 bucks. 

If you have a high conviction play or two, invest there, and watch. Just watch how it responds to events, news, earnings, rate cuts, oil shortages, war, etc. Listen to the calls. Did they lie? Are they  actually part of the con? Diluting your shares annually? 

When you see an acronym you don't understand, that's what you're doing today. Now, not later. Then...you will be smarter and you'll intuitively know that stock's movements. You're golden.

Options you can be 100% right and lose it all. That is a F'd up risk/reward ratio. And it's bait to have you blow up your account, say the line everyone says, buy an etf and let them put it where they want. By the way, I did that for years too.

nj0ushi,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,To people who made millions on SPY 0DTE puts today,Don’t be fooled 0dte is almost always a calculated gamble. Most who win win small and get out early those who hold are waiting on a prayer sometimes it gets answered most of the time it does not. Spx should not swing this much in a single day unless something good or bad happens. This was pure speculation based on a tweet not concrete policy. Expect further declines or rapid recovery.

Friday morning I decided to take some profits on some shares that had a very low cost basis. Glad I did. Pocketed about 25k in profits for NVDA right before the orange turd announced his tariffs. 

That’s all. Felt good to get a bit of luck. Wish you all the best. ",whorainy,0,0.44,11.0,2025-10-12 01:48:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4agjw/best_quick_minute_decision_ive_ever_made/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4agjw/best_quick_minute_decision_ive_ever_made/
nj0t1jf,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,To people who made millions on SPY 0DTE puts today,"When I buy a 0DTE, which I generally only do for SPY or SPX, in the mornings I will assume usually a SL of \~50% (though I don't set it as a hard limit). By mid day I generally assume 100% of my purchase as a risk as contracts have burned nearly all theta and are basically all just leveraged price action. I won't lose 100% and will sell, but I don't put anything into a 0DTE in the afternoon that I'm not willing to lose entirely.

It varies based on the day, but on a 0DTE price scalping trade I'm usually risking a couple hundred bucks, sometimes into the thousands. When I say I do it ""for fun"", I don't view it as a pure gamble, I view it as short term price scalping like I would a futures trade, so I set my risk similarly and I think the payout rates are similar from a risk reward perspective for very short term price scalping. During price scalping while I'm in a trade I am also looking at the charts continuously, unless it's a position that has moved well into profits and I can't watch it, at which point I have a reasonable stop loss set in profit until I can check on it again",wentwj,7,,,2025-10-12 01:47:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o3pmnq/to_people_who_made_millions_on_spy_0dte_puts_today/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o3pmnq/to_people_who_made_millions_on_spy_0dte_puts_today/nj0t1jf/

DOW down 2.4%

S&P down 3.35%

Nasdaq down 4.36%

Is there any other firm that will allow me to buy positions across different multinational markets? Right now I am with Interactive Brokers and hold various stocks across EU markets. I opened the account when I wanted to buy a bunch of EUAD and found that none of the standard brokers here would actually let me buy EUAD.

However, I really dislike IBKR’s UI and their customer service is lacking…

I have everything else in Merill, and while their tech interface sucks it’s a significant upgrade.

Would love any insight. Currently hold shares of Italian, British, German, Swedish, French, and Danish corporations. I could have purchased a few of my positions on OTC markets, but not RNMBY or EUAD, which is a massive percent of my IBKR portfolio.

nj0aafo,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,MAIN & ARCC Dip,"Here’s a helpful way to think about long term investing:

If you’re buying solid companies or funds that you believe in and expect to weather the storm for the long haul, then it doesn’t matter if they’re down 15% because of some shitty, short term market dynamics.

Inflation all but guarantees that securities are going to be worth more in the long term and dollars will be worth less. If you hold these securities for long enough, you’re going to reach a point where they are worth 2x or 3x what they’re worth today just through inflation alone. 

So, don’t worry about (and definitely don’t sell during) a 15% dip due to current headlines about tariffs or anything short-term. If anything, use those dips as buying opportunities to snatch up shares at a discount to multiply the value of those shares decades down the line.",Zmchastain,1,,,2025-10-11 23:51:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o443l0/main_arcc_dip/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o443l0/main_arcc_dip/nj0aafo/

nj03tz3,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Moving from Belgium to Prague — worth it for a family?,"The answer to this would likely be quite personal. It depends what you value I'd say. I say this as someone who moved to Prague in 2019.

Society will be different from what you are used to in Benelux. And you'll need to navigate bureaucracy likely by help of translators and services. Maybe your job will help, if it is ESA you will work for. I even know someone working there. Food quality will also likely not be equal to what you are used to. You can shop at premium grocery services for some improvement, but there is a difference when I shop in Germany.

However, even if you factor in your childcare costs, plus renting, you'd still be left with 3k. For a family like yourself 2k would likely cover everything else you'll ever need, leaving you 1k for savings per month. And that's even if your wife would be a SAHM. Then you'd also save in childcare costs. Services are cheaper, CoL is overall cheaper, you can go out more and do leisure activities. Your income would put you in the top 5% of earners or so, and it would afford you a life of comforts and some luxuries.

If you prefer ""known"" society and quality groceries, plus fear bureaucracy challenges in an unknown language, it might not be for you. 

If you prefer a challenge, an opportunity, a possibility to see another way of life, and are OK with sub par groceries (not like it will be horrible, but there is a noticable quality difference. E.g. hams will proudly put 85% meat on packages... While my family try to find suppliers and products that give 90-95% meat minimum). Then Prague at the salary level mentioned could be a good opportunity.",Gardium90,25,,,2025-10-11 23:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o45niw/moving_from_belgium_to_prague_worth_it_for_a/nj03tz3/

I’m 23 and just started my first corporate job. I’m contributing **6% to my 401(k)** right now (planning to open a **Roth 401(k)** later on once I get more comfortable). My employer uses **Fidelity**, and I tried to build something close to a **total market (VTI)** mix.

Here’s my current breakdown:

* **72%** Fidelity® 500 Index Fund (**FXAIX**)
* **15%** Fidelity® Mid Cap Index Fund (**FSMDX**)
* **8%** Fidelity® Small Cap Index Fund (**FSSNX**)
* **5%** Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares (**VTSNX**)

Employer match kicks in after a year: **dollar-for-dollar up to 3%**, and I’ll be immediately vested once eligible.

Since I’m young with a long investing horizon, I went **100% stocks** for now. I figure I can shift more conservative later when I’m closer to retirement.

China is just the latest in the fear mongering on trade. I remember when it was Japan. Trade jockeying has been a thing for as long as humans have had countries. Empires were built on it.

In any event, the best way to deal with China at this point is to build relationships with other countries so you have enough leverage to get China to change. The US simply does not have the economic leverage at this point. We don’t have a big enough share of China exports. We don’t have anything they truly need at this point.

3) next week has a lot of companies reporting quarterly earnings so at the very least the news cycle will be pushed along by that narrative. it might very well be possible earnings will generally disappoint (or not), but this will be a distraction from trump.

1o45niw,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Moving from Belgium to Prague — worth it for a family?,"Hey everyone, looking for some outside perspective here.

I’m currently based in Belgium with my partner and 2 very young babies (<6-months).

We’re both working — I’m a project manager, she’s in privacy/compliance.

I recently got an offer in Prague (Space, ~€7.7k net/month).

On paper it’s a big step up from my current salary (~€3.1k net + benefits), but… we’d be relocating with two babies, my partner would likely have to quit or go freelance, and the local childcare costs we’re seeing are wild (1K€/month per kid).

We love Belgium’s welfare system — good healthcare, creche availability, predictable admin — and we’re wondering if the move really makes sense once you factor in quality of life, costs, and social safety nets.

For context:

Housing budget in Prague ~€2k/month (need 3 bedrooms).

She might go self-employed for remote compliance work (~€2k/month).

What do you think — for a young family, is Prague a step forward, sideways, or backwards compared to Belgium?

nizh9sw,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"For those who retired and 'invested' wisely, did it really work out in the end?","TL;DR - long term investing in wise stock investments has worked very well. Have enough bonds ready for your first five years of retirement in case you need them if there is a bad stock market correction or crash during you early retirement years.

I invested primarily in my 401K for \~22 years (\~1990-2012) before early retirement at 60. I invested mostly in the growth funds that the 401K had available. The first half of that period I was only investing 6% of pay. I wasn't paying attention to what I should do and didn't have much money anyway. The latter half of that period I maxed out contributions to the 401K. I don't know the percent, but about $20K a year. I was also maxing a Roth IRA the last 10 years.

Good actively managed growth funds aren't bad. They are just not as good as index funds.

When I retired early due to layoff I found that I had more money than I ever thought I would - not $millions, but a lot to me. I have no idea what the percent gain was on the 401K or Roth. I wasn't keeping good records.

Investing through 1990-2012 included the dot com crash, the lost decade, and the 2007 great financial crisis (GFC). Continued investing through those events is actually where I eventually made a lot of my gains because I was buying low. When the raging bull market started \~2009 and continued to today I made a lot of money relative to what I put in.

I have not needed to draw from my investments yet. I have a small pension plus Social Security. If I had needed to draw from the 401K starting during the GFC 2007-2013 that would have been pretty bad. My 401K balance was down \~40% during the worst of that period. This is why to have bonds for five years of expenses by the time you retire so you don't have to draw from equity investments at a loss. I did not know to have bonds like that. I got lucky and didn't need them. That was just luck, not good planning.

Because of the great gains of the post 2009 raging bull market the market could crash by 20%+ and I would still be ahead and I have a lot of bonds now.

Traditional 401Ks and IRAs are deferred income. RMDs are the time that they they start turning into not being deferred. I did not know about RMDs until a couple of years ago. I don't like having to take RMDs that raise my taxes for income I don't need, but that was always the deal for those types of accounts. It's not some new tax.

I have never considered what would be left to beneficiaries or plan to use all I have. I spend what I need or want to and my heirs can have whatever is left over. We never know what will happen in our later years. Long term care like assisted living or skilled nursing facility can cost a shockingly large amount. My mother used $1.5 million for five years in assisted living. I would not want to live that long that way, but you never know what will happen.",bobdevnul,1,,,2025-10-11 21:07:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/nizh9sw/

I remember during the threat government shutdown in the early teens, the market had a bunch of uncertainty and dropped 3% or something like that.  Now we had an actual shutdown and the markets went up.  Like no big deal.

I see the same thing happening with the tariffs.  We get desensitized to the news.  But tariffs can have a real effect on the economy, so some heed is prudent.  Since there is a greater sense of a bubble in the market right now, the market could take a substantial dip.  But the economy is still strong, so the market will likely bounce back quickly.

I find it interesting that we were in a bear market in April coming down 21% from all time intraday highs to lows on April 7th.  That was only 6 months ago.  People talk like we have had a continuous bull market, but in actuality, we've had a major correction in the recent past!

I retired 14 months ago at 55 and I had to work a little harder to do that after two big resets, the dot com crash and the GFC  - My retirement savings were completely wiped out after both events (long stints of unemployment caused me to cash out my 401K at the worst time!).  With some serious scrimping and savings and a fortunate bull market, I was able to hit my goal last year.  Not going to say it was easy but it works - also not getting married and not having kids helped tremendously, lol!

The market was perfectly normal last Summer and it did feel a little weird to cash out some stocks in my brokerage account and put two years in SGOV for safety money.  I rolled my final 401K into my IRA and just invested a large chunk in tech.  I had also socked up a years worth of cash to handle the initial go and due to some cost-cutting I am still using that money.  I initially budgeted to spend 5% and now with my cost-cutting and the market run up this year I am around 3.6 - 3.7%.  April was really scary, but I stuck to my plan and even bought some tech stocks during the dip and it paid off well.

I spent my entire professional career in total rewards and managed retirement plans of all types.  I can't tell you the number of times I would help regular working people and see that they had big balances that you would never have guessed.  Slow and steady wins the race.

I also saw the flip side of never savers and people always taking loans out or just experiencing bad luck.  The system is not perfect (and I have many arguments against the traditional 401K system) but if you steadily save and invest appropriately, it will pay off in the end.

Good luck and keep on investing as much as you can afford -- and then some!",Haunting_Demand_5114,1,,,2025-10-11 20:14:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/niz7iz2/

niym58q,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,S&P 500 vs FTSE All-World — which do you prefer and why?,"I do agree with you but those points are a bit more nuanced:

- Most of the top 500 US are pretty much world companies 

True in a global world, in the America First world however tariffs pretty much guarantee that those companies will be kicked out or will leave their foreign markets. You can’t do global business with protectionism in power. Furthermore those companies are regulated in the US and if the rule of law is being eroded then you as an investor can’t be certain of the information that you are getting.

- US presidents come and go 

Sure, but MAGA is a movement not a person. Movements are notoriously hard to kill. The problems in the US aren’t Trump related, Trump is symptom of a much larger change. We will see if the American people really want this new America and if they will vote MAGA again. 

- US dollar is a reserve currency 

The British pound used to be that not long ago. Things change, sure it will take years but definitely not decades. 

- Europe will never outperform the US

Why? Why we are such pessimists? Look I am from Bulgaria, we were enslaved, under Soviet control, aligned with the Nazis and basically defaulted multiple times over. Yet things are improving significantly since we joined the EU. Sure we don’t have the S&P 500 but Europe has actual economy and world class education and world class people. We will do great. Don’t sell our people short. We have survived much worse things and we are still standing centuries after. The US should be worried since they have never really had a true test of their country and their people. Europe has endured and will endure.

I feel like timing is EVERYTHING with Google. Most stocks, you can be patient and you'll be properly rewarded (assuming you picked a good stock). With Google, it will normally hit it's highest share price in the afterhours right after earnings, and then it won't touch that mark again for months it seems like. So, if you want to try to sell Google at the tippity top, you need to sell in the afterhours right after a good earnings report, because the next market day, it's going to be lower than those highs, like 9 times out of 10.

It's like Google will get it's share of ""pops"", but they're very, very short lived.

1o3ysmi,post,stocks,TSLA,Tesla Inc.,Tesla’s Balancing Act Between Growth and Pressure,"Tesla’s current position in the electric vehicle market shows a mix of strength and strain. The company continues to post record delivery numbers, yet its financials hint at underlying pressure. In FY 2025 Q2, Tesla’s revenue growth declined by 2.73%, and EPS dropped sharply by 53.55%, signaling that profitability remains a concern even with a strong 165.10% rise in free cash flow. These numbers suggest that while Tesla’s core operations are still generating cash, its margins are feeling the impact of competition and pricing adjustments.

Analyst sentiment around Tesla remains divided. Wedbush maintains a bullish view with a $600 target, while Morgan Stanley remains more conservative at $410. The current price of $413.49 places the stock right in the middle of those expectations, reflecting both investor optimism and caution. When I checked the market earlier through bitget onchain, the general sentiment across assets still looked uncertain, and that same tone seems to mirror Tesla’s current setup. The range of price targets, from as low as $276 to as high as $600, shows how differently the market is reading Tesla’s future growth story.

Meanwhile, insider confidence appears strong. Elon Musk recently made 25 purchase transactions worth nearly $1 billion, acquiring just over three million shares on September 12, 2025. These unusually large purchases might be seen as a signal of long-term belief in the company’s direction, even as Tesla faces rising competition in China from BYD, Nio, and other local brands. With gross margins now at 17.48% and operating margins slipping to 6.06%, the next few quarters will show whether Tesla can sustain its leadership while navigating a tighter, more competitive EV market.",Naive_Chipmunk_3850,0,0.22,5.0,2025-10-11 17:40:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3ysmi/teslas_balancing_act_between_growth_and_pressure/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3ysmi/teslas_balancing_act_between_growth_and_pressure/

See most people buy a fund because it has performed well in the last few years.  The S&P 500 has outperformed the world for the last 15 years. This strategy however is literally buy high sell low since everything eventually reverts to the mean. This means that funds or markets that have outperformed will underperform eventually as nothing lasts forever. Historically the world and the US have traded places in terms of performance. Today the US is the clear winner but it is very expensive exactly because of this. 

We also see deterioration of their institutions - where is the latest economic data Donald? Why are you firing Fed officials who refuse to fudge the numbers? 

We also see lawlessness and cartels in the market. AI companies are running a circular economy between each other meaning that if one fails all fail. 

Not to speak about the social and political changes happening, tariffs, antiglobalisation and basically a complete change of the way America views and treats the world. All that combined and you are almost certainly going to see underperformance in the US market. Not to say that we as Europeans have been promoted to enemies of the new US regime and investing in your enemy is a dumb idea.

Hold roughly 2–5 years of planned withdrawals in very safe stuff (cash/T-Bills/CDs/short Treasuries) so you’re never forced to sell stocks when the market is ugly.

In good years, skim gains from the portfolio to refill that bucket; in bad years, spend from the bucket and avoid selling equities. Add simple guardrails: if returns are rough early, trim withdrawals a touch or skip the inflation raise until the portfolio recovers. It’s not free — there’s some cash drag in big bull markets and you have to maintain the ladder/refill habit — but behaviorally it’s gold.

Price action started to look very bearish on the 2 minute and 5 minute chart (started forming lower lows). And I knew if it broke 610, sellers would come in and seek lower open states. I sized for zero. It was swinging wildly and I couldn’t believe that it just kept going down. It would hit my stop and then continue down. Got tired of it so I didn’t scalp the whole day.

niy5s9q,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,To people who made millions on SPY 0DTE puts today,"I am mostly a swing trader and long term investor, but I play with price scalping for fun some. There's a lot of different ways people approach it but generally people are looking at key levels and how price behaves around them. Asia session high/lows, London session high/lows, overall premarket high/lows, 15 minute opening ranges, previous days close/low/high, or just a general break in structure, etc. They look for price behavior around these key levels and then will enter long or short based on their interpretation of price action/order flow, etc.

I don't think price was doing anything interesting around a key level, and I wasn't day trading at the time, but no one I know who trades happened to catch this before it happened so I'm guessing there wasn't any bearish price action happening leading up to it, which if there was already a bearish incline to the market a LOT more people playing 0DTE would have made a ton of money yesterday I think. But I think in general the market was looking more bullish. Option prices also weren't inflated like they are on FOMC days or any days were volatility is expected. I forget the exact number but I looked at it and I think the standard option play if you would have entered expecting bearish action would have done something like 20-50x in like two hours or something absurd.

If you’ve picked one, what made you lean that way?
Was it performance, diversification, currency exposure, or just simplicity?

I’m currently investing monthly and plan to hold for decades, so I’d love to hear your reasoning and personal experience — especially from UK or EU investors.

nixkgrj,comment,europe,SAN.PA,Sanofi SA,"A statue of Fido is unveiled in Borgo San Lorenzo, Tuscany, in 1957. Fido was an English Pointer mutt who waited every day for 14 years the bus his dead owner took to get to work.","Fido (1941 – June 9, 1958) was an Italian dog that came to public attention in 1943 because of his demonstration of unwavering loyalty to his dead master. Fido was the subject of articles appearing in many Italian and international magazines and newspapers, was featured in newsreels throughout Italy, and was bestowed several honors, including a public statue erected in his honor.

Fido probably began life sometime in the autumn of 1941 as an independent street dog in Luco di Mugello, a small town in the municipality of Borgo San Lorenzo, in the Tuscan Province of Florence, Italy. One night in November 1941, a brick kiln worker in Borgo San Lorenzo named Carlo Soriani, on his way home from the bus stop, found the dog lying injured in a roadside ditch. Not knowing whom the dog belonged to, Soriani took him home and nursed him back to health. Soriani and his wife decided to adopt the dog, naming him Fido (""faithful"", from Latin fidus).

After Fido recovered, he followed Soriani to the bus stop in the central square of Luco di Mugello and watched him board the bus for his job. When the bus returned in the evening, Fido greeted Soriani and followed him home. This pattern repeated every workday for two years.

On December 30, 1943, Borgo San Lorenzo was bombed by the Allies during the Second World War, and Soriani was killed. That evening, Fido showed up as usual at the bus stop, but did not see Soriani disembark. Fido later returned home, but for fourteen years thereafter (more than 5,000 times), until the day of his death, he went daily to the stop, waiting for Soriani to get off the bus.

Public interest in Fido grew during his life. Italian magazines Gente and Grand Hotel published the story of the dog, which also appeared in several newsreels of the Istituto Luce. Many readers were struck by the extraordinary faithfulness of Fido, including the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo, who, on November 9, 1957, awarded him a gold medal in the presence of many citizens including Soriani's moved widow. Time magazine wrote an article about Fido in April 1957.

Fido died still waiting for his master on 9 June 1958. The news of his death was announced to the public by the newspaper on a four-column front-page story in La Nazione. Fido was buried outside the cemetery of Luco di Mugello beside his master, Carlo Soriani.

At the end of 1957, when Fido was still alive, the Comune of Borgo San Lorenzo commissioned the sculptor Salvatore Cipolla to create a monument of the dog as a testimony of that exemplary story of love and fidelity. The work, entitled ""Monument to the dog Fido"", was placed in Piazza Dante in Borgo San Lorenzo, next to the municipal palace. Under the statue depicting the dog is the dedication: A FIDO, ESEMPIO DI FEDELTÀ (TO FIDO, EXAMPLE OF LOYALTY). The monument was inaugurated by the mayor of Borgo San Lorenzo, in the presence of Fido and Soriani's widow. Originally, the statue was realized in majolica, but a few months after the inauguration some vandals destroyed it.

nixici4,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,To people who made millions on SPY 0DTE puts today,"i’ve had several conversations here the last few days and I think a lot of people here do not understand how a lot of the people who trade 0dte trade them. There is this misconception that people buy and hold 0dte and while I’m sure some do that’s not in my experience how most trade 0dte for scalping.

I personally have, and know many people, who do very short term scalping with 0dte. You buy expecting a bounce or a breakout, generally exit somewhere -20% to -60% for a SL, and look to profit +20% to 100%+, which all usually happens on 5-20 minutes.

So they are in and out several times a day anticipating big moves. No one I knows happens to have been in puts here surprisingly, but if someone was doing this small scalping, and was manually doing their take profit, they’d have caught the wave and probably at least had runners make a crazy profit",wentwj,80,,,2025-10-11 14:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o3pmnq/to_people_who_made_millions_on_spy_0dte_puts_today/,https://reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o3pmnq/to_people_who_made_millions_on_spy_0dte_puts_today/nixici4/

nixduet,comment,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,This level of Stock Manipulation is totally disgusting!,"I am completely shocked by what I'm reading. You guys are crazy 🤪 whether you like trump or not, at the end of the day he is the President and whether you voted for or against, be grateful just to be an American. I in my opinion... Think everyone who could celebrate a man's assassination, stomp on his grave so to speak... Doesn't belong in America 🇺🇸 We should be grateful we can even do such things as investing, freedom of speech, the right to bare arms. Everyone that celebrates a man's death should be sent to a 3rd world country where there's no food, water, shelter, freedoms period and see what its like to truly suffer and I guarantee they'd all be begging to come back home. Ppl take for granite the luxuries that we have. Do I agree with everything the man does.... ""Hell NOOO"", but he's done more for this country in the first 6 months of his 2nd Presidency then any other President in history. Our borders are safe
Now Mexicans can come back to the USA 🇺🇸 the way my ancestors and I'm sure yours did. Rules are very important in everything we do. Discipline is very hard to come by these days. We live in an age of Millenials and the gens beneath them all act entitled. Screw that, get off your @sses and get a real job. I met a very, very smart young woman on here and her story has blown me away. Her goals, she's very smart at investing, and doesn't frown at a little bit of criticism. It's very unlikely she would ever go postal. She has an amazing portfolio and these are the way all younger kids she be. They should hear her story and follow in her footsteps.
PPL just have to except that the rich will continue to get rich, the poor will be poorer and the middle class will eventually be wiped out. AI is taking away so many jobs, so the only Tru way to make money and have any type of financial security is to ""invest"".... Even if u don't have much in liquid assets... Start with whatever u can, stay focused, disciplined, patient, watch the trends and know when enough is enough and pull out NOT WHEN U THINK U CAN MAKE MORE, BUT EVENTUALLY EVERYTHING THAT GOES UP WILL COME DOWN AND VICE VERSA. Computers, AI, is the future and we just have to accept it. It's kind of sad 😔 that human interaction is becoming scarce, but what can we do? Really... What can we do? Either you go with the flow, stop complaining and do what you have to, in the end you will reap the rewards. If you aren't in the computer tech world.... More and more ppl will be losing their jobs. It's a proven fact. Social Security is going to tank, so if we sent prepared... We will all be screwed, but there's no one to blame but ourselves. Only you can control your destiny. I prefer not to worry about the trivial shit and the shit that Trump is or isn't doing and just live. The old addage will never change. With hard work, comes great reward. When u actually work for things you appreciate them more. If I repeated myself I apologize ahead of time. I'm disabled and some times my fibro fog throws me off, but I think u all get the point. I've been losing faith in humanity for a long time, but it took a 31 yr old man to remind me that God is important, family is impotent, and hard work is the key to success. You may not become millionaires, but the feeling u get from knowing u earned it makes it all worth it
I will say one thing I caught in his last interview. He contradicted himself. He said ""You can't expect people to work for you and work hard if you don't work side by side with them"" he also says that being there for your employees when they are going thru tough times is something basically that you do to help the people you have as employees and lend a hand wherever you can, but later on he said ""The worst thing you can do is be an employees friend""


Well what is it? U either are or aren't. You can't choose how you are going to treat your employees based off your mood that day. CONSISTENCY IS THE KEY!

IF YOU HAVE NO DISCIPLINE, ARE GREEDY, HIGH STRUNG, IMPULSIVE, U WILL NEVER EXCEED IN ANYTHING AND THAT INCLUDES RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL

nixdoo8,comment,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"What should I do with 2,500 shares of RRU (Rolls Royce) after a 988% gain?","When investing in a company I usually have an exit strategy and a goal. So if I were in your shoes my plan would be to stay invested for say 4 years, just as an example, or my fair evaluation of say €10 per share. If I haven’t met my goal on year 4 I would reevaluate if my analysis of the said company was still correct with the new data available. If it was I would stay in, if it wasn’t I would exit even if that meant a loss. In regard to valuation, I would ask myself if this business is worth that valuation. If the answer is no, I would exit, if the answer was yes I would set a new reevaluation date in 1 year. Ask yourself if you believe in RR so much that you would invest €30k in them. If the answer is no either lower your position or liquidate them. No need to lose sleep over an investment. If you are no longer confident in the valuation of RR, take the win and find new company to invest in. 

In regard to taxes, don’t be afraid to pay taxes on your profits. Only fools would rather throw their money into the sea than pay taxes.

Here’s what the long-term chart doesn’t show clearly:
- The fund resets leverage daily. So the 2× exposure is true only intraday, not from your original investment point.
- Over long sideways or volatile periods, compounding turns against you:

Case 1: 10%, -10%, +10%, -10% → net -1% for 1× fund.

1o3qjp4,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"What should I do with 2,500 shares of RRU (Rolls Royce) after a 988% gain?","A few years ago I bought 2,500 shares of Rolls Royce at €1.20 apiece for roughly €3,000 alongside a set of other EU industrial and banking stocks. My investment thesis was that the company was generally undervalued based on its long-term earning potential. I expected slow and steady growth, but nothing crazy. I've been holding the stock in a brokerage I rarely check and was surprised to see that it has grown nearly 988% to €13.06 per share-- nearly €32,000.

I am tempted to sell because I feel as though while the mid-term prospects of the company have changed, there are still issues with its long-term fundamentals-- namely the cyclical nature of aereospace / defense. I'm afraid it has turned into a bit of a meme stock. I live in Germany and would need to pay capital gains on the sale. 

I'm not looking for advice regarding whether the company is a good buy at its current price point or poised for more growth. No one can answer that. Rather, what rules / framework do you have in place for determining when to sell and how much to sell following a massive gain? I'd like to make as rational of a decision as possible.

niwotx3,comment,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,This level of Stock Manipulation is totally disgusting!,"Ok, I'm still a guy who is learning the market here and I'm open to admitting that I've missed something here with my reply. So please poke holes in my take here - which I'm sure there are many. I am absolutely open to learning more because I have only been involved in the market for 2 years... From my observations in that time, I have to say that posts surrounding ""stock manipulation"" seem to be chronically synonymous with any type of correction like what happened on Friday. 

What I'm about to say here might be construed as disrespectful, and I don't mean it that way, and for many people here, it will make for a waste of time for them to read, but I'm going to say it anyway, because I feel like anybody posting about stock manipulation during a correction or full fledged downturn need to get checked so they aren't misguiding others... 

Again, I can't stress enough that I mean this with the minimum amount of disrespect — people here are saying nothing when they cite market manipulation as the reason for their losses.

Inside trading exists. By default, institutional traders hold all the cards and otherwise “manipulate” the market by design. Meanwhile, most retail investors are either deep in greed euphoria or panic selling depending on how the candles look that day.

The so-called Magnificent 7 are grossly overvalued and have an obscene stranglehold over the S&P — and it only slipped 4%? Why? Because the autist-in-chief said something ridiculous in any lens.

The worst-case scenario hasn’t even happened yet. Whether that’s next Monday, next month, or next year — the market is absurdly overvalued. Retail shouldn’t be thinking about damage minimization during a correction or getting greedy during a rally. They should be setting their stops when these overvalued stocks (many operating at a loss and only rallying on sentiment) are still green — and taking profits for a later date.

Failing that, if they have conviction in their positions, then fine — weather the red candles.

But this whole “the market makers are manipulating the market” line is rampant among bagholders.

I’m saying nothing new to anyone who actually understands how the market ticks — but posts like these shouldn’t be getting a soft pass.

Retail needs to understand diligence. The market is inevitably going to fall apart. That’ll be the result of greedy investors who got carried away in the gold rush and didn’t stop to think how an obscenely overvalued, top-heavy S&P could keep running without consequences.

Then, when the obvious correction comes, the same people cry “market manipulation” instead of asking, “why didn’t we see this one coming?”

If you’re up, set your stops and take some profit before it all corrects — or crashes. None of these “it’s manipulation” narratives. They help nobody.

Again, for anyone who’s been around a while — I’m saying absolutely nothing you don’t already know. But for the people shouting “manipulation,” no… this is just the natural conclusion of an overvalued market.

Nothing about the “top companies” changed in the last 48 hours, except that the market has overvalued them beyond reason — and now the institutional traders are laughing at the people who helped oversell them.

The market will bounce back eventually — it always does — but citing manipulation every time there’s a red day is just denial.

This subreddit should honestly do itself a favor and start removing posts that even mention the word manipulation.",Candid_Ideal_2553,-5,,,2025-10-11 09:44:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o3lkkl/this_level_of_stock_manipulation_is_totally/,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o3lkkl/this_level_of_stock_manipulation_is_totally/niwotx3/
niwotdk,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"For those who retired and 'invested' wisely, did it really work out in the end?","Not a retiree (yet) myself, but I can see a couple things happening:

* New income streams like Social Security and pensions become available and take priority over drawing from investments. You'll (almost) always get them at regular intervals, so you spend that first. Likely they already cover the bulk of your daily expenses, particularly if you've paid off most of your life debts (eg: house, cars) at that point.

* Aging is a bitch. Your body's failing, you simply won't have the energy nor the capability to enjoy life like you could in your 30s and 40s, let alone your 10s and 20s. You've (hopefully) got lots of money, but you don't have much time left and the time you do have you physically can't make thorough use of. This limits luxury spending.

* Health insurance *generally* begins to cover more, coincidentally right as your health starts failing and medical costs start going up. Once you're within range of Medicare coverage (or your country's equivalent), most medical costs aren't a concern anymore. This eases expenditure pressure on your budget.

* Retiring doesn't mean not having a professional income stream anymore. Plenty of retirees still ""work"", whether for fun as a hobby or because they need something to do with their time. Having nothing to do when you're old is an express ticket to the afterlife.

* A 4% increase is a 4% increase, whether your principal is big or small. It's probably big at the advanced stages in your life, so the same increase that you wouldn't care about during your 30s has become very impressive now in your 70s. Likewise decreases, of course; have some bonds/""bonds"" (Social Security, pensions)/cash so you can afford to not care about them.",Dalewyn,32,,,2025-10-11 09:44:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/niwotdk/
1o3pih8,post,investing,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,Investing in my early twenties,"Hi, I'm 20 years old and currently a student. I've been investing for a while now, so far I've invested around $35,000. Most of my portfolio is in domestic stocks from my country, but recently I’ve started allocating a larger portion to international stocks like Nvidia, AMD, SoFi, the S&P 500, and so on. I also have a part of my portfolio in Bitcoin.
I plan to invest around $350 every month. Do you think that's too small of an amount?
Since I’m investing regularly and with a long-term perspective, is it important to actively follow stock prices and try to buy only during dips, or does that not really matter in the long run?
Do you think the amount I've already invested, combined with the $350 I plan to add monthly, could grow into something meaningful over the next 10 to 15 years or are these amounts too small?
Also, is Bitcoin a smart investment in general ? Considering my age and higher risk tolerance.

1o3p120,post,stocks,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti,"$LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security & IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives. It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \~1,500× & 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power & a Wix website. 

SEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness & a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, & branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” & “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 & reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products & the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month & carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards & a rotation of partnerships & acquisitions.  
  
When the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence. Quantum computing demands a level of obsessive attention to detail: fractions of a Kelvin, picosecond timing, noise isolation at the edge of physics. When the front end looks half-finished, it’s hard not to question whether that discipline extends behind the lab door. Something doesn’t add up. Have you seen SEALSQ’s website? If corporate websites are any proxy for DNA, SEALSQ looks like it’s building things that actually work.   
  
Expect a fresh wave of press releases & conveniently timed analyst upgrades in the near term. The Quantum + AI Conference: alternately marketed as Quantum + AI 2.0 or IQT Quantum + AI, depending on who’s paying for the banner, will occur October 19–21, 2025, in New York City. The agenda promises deep inquiry into the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, & cryptographic security. Attendees can expect the full liturgy: keynotes, panels, mentoring sessions, & exhibitions. Organized in part by Inside Quantum Technology (IQT), the event serves as yet another congregation of researchers, investors, & professional futurists between funding rounds. $LAES SEALSQ headlines with the highest tier of logo placement. Amazon AWS, Nvidia, IonQ, Rigetti, Salesforce, Amgen, CNN, & Cantor Fitzgerald will also attend.

Rest can go into a long term low cost fund like VWCE or WEBN.

1o3on07,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,NVDA to the moon,"A lot of people have been talking about how NVDA is going to hit a wall and decline with respect to revenue from new installs but I'm here to say why that argument is wrong.

They're saying its like the fiber companies of the dot com era.

But for two reasons it's not. 1. not ""dark fibre"" comparison. The chips are fully utilized. 2. The difference in useful life. A GPU rack is 4-6 years, fibre optic cable is 25-40 years.

This idea started when I was listening to this podcast today [https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626) where at about the 1hr mark they're talking about the CAPEX/OPEX of data centres.

Someone points out and Chamath agrees that the chip failure rate is between 9%-20% in these GPU racks which is insanely high! I also think I remember Dylan Patel saying something similar on a a16z episode.

From those two data points alone [I](https://pocket-quant.com/dashboard?share=0199d1fe-157a-7383-b4bd-45b8fba4e38d) extrapolated that NVDA might be sitting on somewhere between $27B per year and $60B/year in basically recurring revenues from the need to replace failed racks

Once you add in a 4-6 year replacement cadence for the rest of the chips you're looking at anywhere from $90 BILLION to $140 BILLION a year in recurring revenue from scheduled replacements and failures. This is not including future buildout.

  
This isn't just going to act as a floor to their revenues for years if not decades to come. It is their ENTIRE current revenue. They're looking at a massive and durable business just like INTC, hopefully they don't drop the bag like INTC once they're in pole position.

Also according to this deep research report the average chip cycle is 10 years long and we're in year 3ish [https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143](https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143)

That's just short selling. It's not market manipulation by design.

>Every stock is like this. Microsoft is short 54,926,474 shares at $500 per share equals $27,463,237,000. If short sellers closed their short positions, they would have to buy $27 Billion in shares.

Which also means nothing, since $27B isn't even a rounding error to MSFT's market cap.

> In the meantime, that money is changing the value of something else. Short sellers might even have taken the money in dividends or free loans to themselves and it might never come back.

Short sellers don't hold shares to take dividends. As for free loans, yeah, I guess they could use the money they get from sale proceeds, but if they can't recoup the shares they sold because they blow it they'll end up bankrupt, which happens when you gamble recklessly. And those loans aren't free, they have to pay interest to keep the short position open.

The economy is never perfect.

Let those two truths sink in for a minute. The gap between those two statements has to be closed at some point. Between the two options repricing down is easier. Building the economy up to that price is the harder task. 

I hope you weren't deep into calls or leveraged etfs. If so I'm sorry but this day probably sucked for you. 

Ive been sitting in tlt for months because I assumed this day and more like it were probably coming. Maybe this year maybe next, but they were coming. The stock market is based upon a lot of things, but ultimately economic activity has to happen at a rapid pace for the stock market to do well. We currently have a bunch of problems around the world and the US has an administration that is hellbent on reducing global trade. We just spent 50 years building up globalization and reducing barriers to trade and that greatly benefited people. The benefits were definitely not even, but they were there. Now we unwind that and depending upon how deep we unwind this could be really ugly. 

If you dont want to stress about the ""manipulation"" you probably need to not be betting on one outcome or the other within a limited window of time.

The fact that NBIS blew up so fast, was not in my sights and I HIGHLY regret everything. After researching, I still think NBIS has far to go, before it nears its cap. Most likely going to hold atleast 35 shares at minimum for the next year or 2.

not sure I want to allocate to this one. Drawdown of NAV similar to underlying QQQ during April crash. And YTD appears maybe slightly underperforming QQQ.

IDVO: 

on quick glance, looks to be exceptional with great total YTD return despite the April crash, seems good way to diversify for “international exposure”. Drawdown similar to international ex US etf but dividends allowing it to outperform overall. Also good track record since inception in 2022.

QQQI:

Looks ok with similar drawdown to QQQ in april crash but total outperforming QQQ ytd. However, very new fund since Jan 2025.

QDVO: 

Looks good. Drawdown smaller than QQQ in April. Outperforming QQQ total YTD return. But, also quite new since 2024. 

Any other similar tickers anyone can recommend? Many other tickers look so bad, like QYLD, XDTE, JEPQ etc in comparison have horribly underperformed the above.

Hood has been a monster. I personally think Vlad is executing at a high level and will be one of the biggest winners in fintech over time (why I’m still holding shares there). Webull is a smaller fish making their way around the pond right now. I don’t know many folks who use them, but I assume they’re out there. They’ve seen 46% YoY revenue growth, have 1.6 billion in cash, solid growth in assets under custody, international growth prospects, new product line potentials, and are now sitting at just a $5b MC. 

It is not overly valued compared to many other high flyers right now that are still up multiple baggers YTD even with this pullback. Maybe it trades down to the $9-10 range with increased market weakness but I’m feeling very comfortable at these levels for a longer term bet on this being a big outperformer in the near future.

1o3j65j,post,stocks,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Gilat Satellite (GILT) might be seriously under radar and undervalued,"We are talking about an Israeli satcom/defense company with 35 years of story, it is valued like a small cap at $874,08 mi, despite projecting a guidance of $450 million total revenue in 2025, that's 45% increase compared to 2024 YoY. 

It is currently trading at around 25–30 times forward EPS despite growing revenue over 40% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA has climbed from about $30 million in 2022 to a projected $50 million for 2025, maintaining solid double-digit margins even as revenue grows more than 40%.

But now let's dive in:

What does it do?
Gilat builds the hardware and software that let satellites deliver internet, military comms, and inflight Wi-Fi anywhere on Earth. 
It doesn’t launch satellites, it builds the infrastructure that makes satellites useful for its customers.

Recent acquisitions:
In recent years, Gilat acquired Wavestream, DataPath, and Stellar Blu to cover every layer of satellite communication, from radio amplifiers and tactical defense terminals to high-speed antennas for aircraft, turning itself from a modem maker into a full-scale satellite infrastructure company. All three based on American soil.

Tech achievements: 
Gilat is transforming from a traditional satellite equipment supplier into a modern communications technology company. It develops cloud-based and AI-driven network platforms, advanced antennas for in-flight connectivity, and secure communication systems for defense and government use. Through its U.S. subsidiaries, the company now integrates hardware, software, and network management to support multi-orbit satellite operations (LEO, MEO, GEO). Its focus on virtualization, automation, and mobility positions Gilat as one of the leading players in next-generation satellite connectivity.

Customers and contracts: 
Active contracts span defense, aviation, and government broadband programs worldwide with a total backlog of roughly US$450 million and customers ranging from the DoD (US$70 million), Israeli Army, OneWeb and national telecom agencies worldwide.

Cash and debt: 
After the Stellar Blu acquisition, Gilat’s cash dropped from about $118 million to roughly $5 million, later rebuilt to around $65 million through a private share placement. Total debt stands near $100 million, leaving net debt around $30–40 million, a manageable level at less than one times projected 2025 EBITDA.

Conclusion:
In my view, Gilat is one of those “boring” and overlooked companies that deliver solid results and techs and have consistent growth, but lacks hype. It doesn’t build rockets or launch flashy satellites but it builds the wiring, antennas, and network brains that keep everything connected once those satellites are in orbit. It’s full of cables, code, and complex connectivity, but together they form the invisible backbone of defense communications, inflight Wi-Fi, and rural broadband. Gilat sits on the real infrastructure of global communication: profitable, under-the-radar, technically dense, and strategically essential for the defense industry, at a price of a small cap but with serious backlog, tech and guidance.

nivcbz3,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,When to sell?,"You have to first ask, is this a long or short play? Is this a company you think will really be worth something in 20 years, or do you want to bank money and try to cycle into something else? Once you decide that, then have you considered a trailing stop loss? Somewhere between 15-20% and it will move up as the stock does. But it holds when it falls, and if you cross the limit it will execute a sale. This is not the right tactic for every ticker, but it could be worth considering for this one, depending on their volatility.

Good luck!",RadiantRecord1413,1,,,2025-10-11 03:12:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o31zyz/when_to_sell/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o31zyz/when_to_sell/nivcbz3/

\- Build a boring “paycheck” first. 2–5 years of spending in cash/T-Bills/short bonds. That kills the panic if the market pukes the day you retire.  
\- Automate the rest. Set target weights and rebalance when something drifts ±15–20%. No hero calls, just rules.  
\- Decide early: do you want to die rich or live well? If leaving a big inheritance matters, set a “legacy sleeve” you don’t touch and spend from the rest.

I also started a ROTH IRA, which I could put $2000 a year in.   I was laid off from the first job in 2008-9 during a massive cut that swamped the area with unemplyeed people in my area and took one that paid about 1/2 of the first job.   But it took 10 months and I was a bit worried.  

But I keep saving, and tried to even save more each year, also got some side work and put almost all of it towards ROTH and other savings.   After 15 years there, I was just laid off again.  but now I can afford to take an early retirment package and I'm not worried now, I have enough saved to be comfortable in retirement.   So, yes, Virgina, there is a retirement saving plan that works.   It just requires that you save maybe 10% a year in your 401K, Roth or whatever you can save it in.   And I used mostly simple index funds, like S&P500, dividend funds, some bonds, some international, and more.    I have now combined all of our (me and wife) various 401k's and such into a few accts, and now have most of the funds into ETFs (equity, bond, muni, and REITS) and number of individual stocks to help me balance out the account, diverify, and give some protection from market swings.",BobtheChemist,1,,,2025-10-11 02:10:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3g6z8/for_those_who_retired_and_invested_wisely_did_it/niv34rq/

1o3fih6,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Trading Options for Primary Income - Monthly AMA Pt7,"Hey everyone, setting up this month's AMA to catch up with everyone and chat about trading!

  
These posts aren't geared towards the lottery winner hopefuls - although I genuinely wish them the best as well. They're geared towards those who have traded a little, can see the opportunity but also understand there is work involved. 



**Background** for those interested:

My name is Erik. I'm a Marine Corps veteran and full time options trader. I started in 2007 and maintain a mid 20% CAGR. I’ve been active in this community since 2020.

I grew up in a low income single parent household. Trading became my path to financial independence, coupled with aggressive savings. I’ve since invested over 35,000 hours developing this skill set.

I built my initial trading capital through manual labor — splitting wood, moving shale, selling Christmas trees, maintaining a bowling alley. During college (funded through a Marine Corps scholarship), I flipped cars and motorcycles to grow my capital base. In my mid-20s, I expanded into residential real estate, and commercial in my early 30s.

I view wealth-building through three levers: **Savings**, **Investing**, and **Income**. You cannot save your way to wealth alone — you must compound. Early on, your savings rate matters most; as your capital grows, returns begin to dominate.

Trading is more challenging than most of us think it will be when first starting. However it’s nothing insurmountable either. It’s entirely possible to achieve your financial goals through markets. It does requires consistent effort sustained over time and a thoughtful approach.

**Why I do this**. There are two primary reasons why I do this.

1. My primary motivation is the desire to “pay it forward”. A high school teacher introduced me to investing. Because of him, I retired my mother and hit financial freedom.
2. My second driver is a passion for teaching and helping others. Growing up with a single mom father, I learned the value of being “raised by a village”.
3. **Bonus:** I’m fascinated by markets and genuinely enjoy the craft.

Below are some previous posts that lay a basic foundation for trading.

2. ⁠Stop Wandering Aimlessly- ⁠Offers a general learning syllabus for new options traders: ⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1c3hgfh/stop\_wandering\_aimlessly/

China is using the same tactics the USA has deployed against China (both in pursuit of each countries perceived interests). This isn't something that'll go away without a drastic change in the global environment.

My prediction is Trump messed up the tactics on this though, they didn't realize China would pull such a huge lever like this. RAE export controls would severely disrupt all AI data centers, defense hardware production, and basically destroy the economy, if it goes on for more than a few weeks.

This is not just TACO, this is an escalation (or just a tit for tat since the USA has tried to kneecap Chinese AI progress). If the USA doesn't fold, that means we're in for a world of short term economic pain that would probably kill the last 3 months of US stock market growth at the minimum.

1o3ewij,post,stocks,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI,"Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned.

Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.

The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.

Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.

Xiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.

Investors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.

Prompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.

Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.

Silicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple’s deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company’s founder and other execs, and Google’s $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf’s CEO and leaders that included licensing fees.

Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple’s biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines.

Some analysts have attributed Apple’s relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps.

While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker’s foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users.

Prompt’s technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple’s HomeKit smart home division.

My thesis isn't about whether Wall Street cares. It was about Trump seeing social media being used by Gen Z to overthrow an entire government. The fear by Republicans is that it starts small with Trump assasination attempts, UNH CEO, Charlie Kirk. And before you know it, he fears that there's a risk of a civil unrest and violent protests all across the US.

I'm not making the argument that this will or won't happen. But I was just explaining that this was a strong reason why RDDT dumped based on the timeline of RDDT's stock movement, beyond just being overbought. That said, with the entire market dumping, it's kind of irrelevant. Only thing that matters now is RDDT is deeply oversold despite a strong earnings set up, so I think it'll be one of the first to pop back up since most other stocks have only just started to correct.",OmgItsMrTinkles,1,,,2025-10-11 00:04:25,https://i.redd.it/ydve6ozo1auf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/niuj368/

Drop's definitely not more severe yet, nor was panic (or tariffs) louder.

niuig9x,comment,wallstreetbets,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (Google),"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","Ok I didn't read the post but I get the gist,  op and family blootered a fortune into reddit. 
Nobody asked for my opinion so here it is;


I like reddit and I spend too much time on it, and I try to convince my friends to do the same.  Someone asked me why I liked reddit and I told them it's the only social media that doesn't make me want to smash my phone up.  Now you could argue that it's not a true social media,  whatever,  but I can't stand FB, insta, xitter,  YouTube,  I only use them when I can't avoid it.  But I can happily spend hours every day on reddit.  


Mainly be cause I'm not getting fed Conservative propaganda here but I do feel that they are reluctantly getting with the mango programme.  When I started a new account I was being fed a steady diet of right wing rage bait 


I understand that big businesses have to compromise to stay in business in the current climate but if reddit loses its usp as the only kinda independent big social platform then it has to fall back on the hobbyist,  forum type users.  And that's not big advertising money, I'd Say .


The bots  are getting out of hand,  not necessarily intrusive,  just clogging up the conversation with inane jokey meme comments.  When a big news story breaks I can read about it in maybe 5 front page type subs,  and it's the same endless joke chains,  when I want to read real discussion and opinion.  I can't honestly believe that's real people taking the time to type lazy one liners thousands of times a day. 


And the censorship is getting worse.  If reddit is so scared to upset the snowflake Conservative ruling class it's going to lose its remaining credibility.  


There is a place for reddit,  between the overly earnest and wholesome Liberal spaces and the right wing cesspits.  If it moves in either direction its gonna fail. ",Dear_Smoke6964,7,,,2025-10-11 00:00:42,https://i.redd.it/ydve6ozo1auf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/niuig9x/

Donald J. Trump Truth Social Post 04:50 PM EST 10/10/25 

It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

In general, you should sell when you don't believe in the company anymore, if you think its price is much too high, it has grown to represent too much of your portfolio, or you're looking to pare risk. How you determine those things is a matter of process and opinion.

Maybe it keeps going up, maybe not, but you've done very well either way. Going forward, you will gradually save more and become more diversified.

1o3afia,post,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Trump is at it again. Black Friday is damn true.,"Today's market was outrageous. The SPY crashed the moment it opened, the Nasdaq fell almost 2.6%, and the Dow Jones plummeted over 600 points, all because Trump made a crazy announcement that morning about imposing ""massive tariffs"" on China, citing the rare earth issue. He implied that China was using rare earths to ""control the global supply chain."" The market immediately imploded. The algorithmic market crashed, and retail investors followed suit, panicking. Tech, semiconductors, and manufacturing sectors were all decimated. Ironically, rare earth and mining stocks actually rallied. Isn't that ironic? Didn't we just go through this in April? Back then, he also mentioned tariffs, sending the market into a panic, only to crash and then recover. This time, it felt similar, only louder and the drop was even more severe. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all. Having been in this business for 20 years, I've seen this kind of drama countless times. When the news breaks, everyone jumps on it, no one looking at the fundamentals. A company that was doing well the day before was slashed in half because of a tweet. I reduced my holdings a bit today, but I didn't sell. I kept some cash and will see how things play out next week. If it drops another 2% or 3%, I might start slowly adding to my holdings. This isn't a systemic crash, it's just panic. If there's anything I can really learn, it's this: don't jump in when others are collapsing.

I haven't been big into any upstream O&G, but this isn't an E&P company. They own and operate gas compression in the Permian for both crude and natural gas. The balance sheet has been improving and they have sold off lower head units for high-compression due to more favorable margins. It pays a fairly sizeable dividend, which I'm not super happy about but its well covered with EPS...since more of the demand is contracted its fairly stable moving forward.

Considering most of the new data centers are either being built in Texas or within the operating NG pipelines, compression will continue to be in high demand, especially since natural gas will be the go-to power supplier for data centers for at least the next 18-24 months.",salty0waldo,4,,,2025-10-10 21:26:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/nitpgi8/

‘Changing of the guard’ between the Italian Air Force aircrafts deployed as part of NATO's Enhanced Air Policing (EAP) mission, which contributes to the surveillance and defence of the Alliance's eastern flank.

The handover ceremony marked the end of the Task Group Lightning mission, which operated for two months in Estonia with F-35 aircrafts.

During the mission, over 150 sorties and 300 flight hours were carried out, with numerous interceptions of unidentified aircrafts.

This is the third time that the Italian Air Force has deployed personnel and equipment to Estonia and the second time that F-35s have participated in NATO's security mission in the Baltic, on the easternmost flank of the Atlantic Alliance.

The mission will continue with Eurofighters, maintaining its capabilities unchanged and confirming Italy's commitment to the collective security of the Atlantic Alliance.

With Operation Baltic Eagle III, the Italian Air Force is contributing to the protection of the airspace of the Baltic Republics as part of NATO's enhanced Air Policing mission, whose objective is to preserve allied airspace while ensuring the country's training needs are met.

The Air Task Force is redeployed at Ämari Airport, a few kilometres from Tallinn, and has deployed F-35A aircrafts from the 32nd Wing in Amendola and the 6th Wing in Ghedi, now replaced by Eurofighter Typhoon multi-role aircrafts from the 4th Wing in Grosseto, the 36th Wing in Gioia del Colle, the 37th Wing in Trapani and the 51st Wing in Istrana. The Task Force also deployed the Gulfstream G550 CAEW (Conformal Airborne Early Warning) aircraft from the 14th Wing for aerial surveillance, search and control tasks, and the SAMP/T missile system from the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Command in Sabaudia for protection against aerial threats.",TheCommentaryKing,9,,,2025-10-10 21:11:21,https://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/news/difesa-estonia-gli-eurofighter-subentrano-agli-f-35/,https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o3a0t5/nato_baltic_air_policing_estonia_eurofighters/nitml4j/

nitho63,comment,investing,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Any stocks I should be selling that will get extra hit by China/USA high tariffs,"Watch the video and you may change your mind. 

In brief, using an emergency under IEEPA to justify broad tariffs makes no sense because an emergency, by definition, must be unusual, unexpected, and sudden. Trump’s own lawyers argue that 50 years of trade deficits are the “emergency,” which is bogus.

Secondly, using the same justification *this* Supreme Court used to shut down Biden’s student loan forgiveness, “the major questions doctrine” states that questions of major political or economic significance may not be delegated by Congress to executive agencies absent sufficiently clear and explicit authorization.

Again, Trump’s lawyers argued that without these tariffs, there would be economic calamity, this meets the definition of a major question impacting all of the USA.  

So I think it’s likely it will get bounced back to Congress where it belongs, and Congress will face significant pressure from their constituents to not continue these unpopular tariffs.",wampum,4,,,2025-10-10 20:46:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o36wtj/any_stocks_i_should_be_selling_that_will_get/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o36wtj/any_stocks_i_should_be_selling_that_will_get/nitho63/

(je m'excuse d'avance si je ne suis pas sur le bon forum) 

Je suis une étudiante en Master psychologie et j'ai vu que certain de mes cours seraient très pratique à prendre avec une tablette. Mais je n'en ai pas. 

J'aimerais donc me prendre une tablette/ipad pour mes cours officiellement mais pas que bien évidemment. À côté j'aimerais pourvoir éditer des photos, faire du dessin (juste comme occupation tiers je ne suis pas Dali), regarde séries/films (classique), etc une utilisation polyvalente finalement. 

Mais je ne sais pas trop quoi prendre. Car je n'ai jamais eu d'appareil Apple mais je n'entends pas de positifs sur les appareils Android. (notamment au niveau des ram ou askip les Android sont très nuls contrairement aux Apple). Donc je pensais prendre un Ipad air car je peux m'envoyer les documents important par mail car c'est des fichiers pas très lourds ou utiliser une clé usb et cela ne me dérange pas.

Initialement je pensais partir sur un ipad air 5, mais au vu de l'année de sorti je me suis dis qu'un 6 serait peut être préférable. Voir le 7 si les prix en reconditionné ne sont pas trop loin.

nit46t0,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Oct 10, 2025","Not sure what to think right now. On the one hand, there seem to be a lot of risks. The economy is not great, not terrible, but far from great. Labor market is weak. Government is shut down and pretty soon millions will be without a pay check. Trade tensions are ratcheting back up with China. Mexico’s tariff pause expires in a few weeks and there’s no deal. On the AI front, big picture, we’re now three years from the launch of ChatGPT and AI still can’t make any money. Perhaps worse, there’s a cavernous gap between capex and projected revenue from end use cases. It doesn’t seem like that ever gets filled. The circular financing happening right now is reminiscent of past bubble behavior.

There’s more but all this makes me think maybe stocks should not be at the highest valuations in US history? Maybe they shouldn’t go up every day? Maybe we shouldn’t have by far the most concentrated market in history? Maybe we should be pricing some risk that things don’t pan out according to the most optimistic scenarios, maybe stocks aren’t really risk free assets. 

But then on the flip side, there’s really compelling bullish arguments as well. For example, an analist yesterday said he thinks NVDA is worth 7 trillion. In explaining why, he made a really persuasive point. He said of NVDA, “baby it was born to run”. I don’t think a reasonable person can argue with that.

So yeah, really well reasoned, persuasive arguments on both sides. I’ll need to think on this over the weekend. But in the meantime, while I figure out whether I believe stocks are obscenely over valued or we should just sing Bruce Springsteen and smash the buy button, the only reasonable thing to do is max out the margin debt, maybe the HELOC as well and yolo it all on quantum and space junk.",MrRikleman,6,,,2025-10-10 19:38:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/nit46t0/

1o37ho2,post,eupersonalfinance,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,How much should an 18yr old invest?,"(Translated using Google Translate)

I’m 18 years old and have €20,000 saved after a gap year working full-time. Now I'm starting my studies again, so my income will drop sharply. I also still live at home, so I spend very little. I've been exploring investing in stocks and/or ETFs for a while now. I just don't know how much of my money I should allocate for that. I don't have a father, and my mother is very much against it because she doesn't understand much about it. She says I should just keep it all in my savings account, but I'm not at all keen on that. What's your advice? I could invest almost anything, since I'm probably not moving out for a few years and will hardly spend my money until then.

How much of the entirety of everything that they do, including Google search and YouTube ad revenue, is selling AI hardware?

NVIDIA’s entire business has become selling hardware for this purpose, Google doesn’t even do that, and NVIDIA’s volatility hinges on that market, which has allowed its valuation to skyrocket without real competition.

Google is investing heavily long-term into their own strategy; they’re not a hardware company and aren’t in the business of selling shovels, nor are they trying to be.

I didn’t think it was that big of a deal but then my son was all sad we didn’t do anything special for his “golden” birthday after his classmates told him about the concept. I’d been meaning to do start a small portfolio for him outside of his 529 plan and thought shares of IAU might be fun. 

I’ve looked into UTMA but I still want a little extra control about when I hand any windfalls over since my son has ADHD and from my experience with other family members with ADHD is that late adolescence can get be the most challenging time when dealing with personalities that can be more inclined than others incline towards addictions and risky behavior. 

One always hopes their kid will grow up responsible, but I’m iffy on legally being required to hand him thousands of dollars at 18 if he’s going through a rough phase, experimenting with substances, making other spontaneous or unsafe decisions. I’ve seen the previously best behaved kids in my family fall off a cliff at 18 and stumble for a few years and I think a windfall at 18 is just something I’m not comfortable with - if it was 21 or 25, that would be a different story.

Besides the stake they got, they are also building huge centers to support Anthropic's computation needs. I'm bullish on Anthropic and why I think holding to AMZN makes sense. 


Worth mentioning that Google also invested a lot into Anthropic and has a stake, maybe even larger than Amazon's. It's still mostly private information.

We've been using ML for this purpose for a long time already. It certainly has helped, but it isn't new, and it isn't radically changed by the popularization of LLMs. If your investment thesis for LLM companies is ""cure for cancer"" then you are going to be disappointed, because they are not leading in this space. LLMs might simplify the process of diagnosis or creating treatment plans, but that's an efficiency improvement, not a cure. 

As for Nvidia, it's easy to get lucky, because whether it's ML, or LLMs, or Crypto the compute cores they provide are the ""picks and shovels"" play of this gold rush. But, like the gold rush, not everyone is going to get rich, and many of these ""AI"" startup companies will go bankrupt without ever turning a profit, and that is the bubble that everyone else is referring to.",p3dal,5,,,2025-10-10 17:33:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o32ro4/ai_is_not_in_a_bubble_or_is_it/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o32ro4/ai_is_not_in_a_bubble_or_is_it/nisehbc/

The sales growth is insane, the stock could easily 10x, but with the current instability in government overshadowing future contracts & potential slowing down in the economy and the fact that SpaceX is crushing them in revenue, it's doubtful they can continue to match their 50% to 100% sales growth every year, but that's my opinion.

European companies, start-ups and governments are in dire need of funding - compared to the US. Even if your money is in a bank account, it allows banks to provide productive loans to companies and households.

So even if you sold apple and then just bought the broader market you lost some returns but are still way up and you sacrificed risk (concentration in Apple stock) with diversification. Unsurprisingly, sometimes safer, more diversified investments can come with modestly lower gains.

So frankly, unless you sold apple and just gambled on crypto meme stocks or other individual stocks that trailed the market, you made a perfectly good investment decision with only a modestly lower rate of return. 

So I would argue this is unlikely to have been even close to the worst financial decision you have made in your life, and if you’re beating yourself up over it then I think you learned the wrong lesson about investing.

This is like when people say “I should have bought Bitcoin when it was valued at $20”. That was my worst financial decision ever!

Financially, you should be fine.  At your age and with over €1,000,000 invested, you are in a great spot. 

The challenge will be employment.  No, you cannot work your American job in France.  Only exception would be if they have an office there and you’re employed through there, or they use an EOR.

One option is to start your own business and do contract with work your old company.  Pitch it to them as they save $$ as they don’t have to pay you American benefits (which based on experience owing a business, was my second largest expense behind payroll).

Who knows if they’d agree, but if you’re good enough at what you do they would. That said, with time zones being a thing, working North American hours may be a concern for you.  Some people I know love that schedule…but if/when kids come into the picture…it could become problematic.

Whatever you do, if you want it, you’ll find a solution.

I anticipate/hope we will get the statistics folks to reformulate the current market ratios and create new ones and tell us which ones are important and which ones aren’t and we’ll have at least 3 people who redefine the term ‘Bubble’ so that the answers will be a lot more nuanced then yes or no. We should welcome all of that and get everyone’s views because in the end, NONE of us will be completely correct!

My take, we have too many young traders who treat the stock market like a casino. For that reason, uneducated sentiment has the capacity to drive dips and swells and volatility which we might call a ‘Bubble’ when too many gamblers are riding a group of stocks or indexes simply because they think they can time the market and market sentiment.  But AI will escape the Bubble fate in the bear term because while it may be more expensive then past market leaders, it is not illogically priced and the opportunity to own a piece of the current technology is like the opportunity to own copper before electricity or oil before automobiles.  And a key difference is that it is mostly intangible “Intellectual Property” that is owned and unlike a physical commodity, it can be leveraged an infinite amount of ways, so the earnings capacity of a single piece of AI code has almost limitless earnings capacity.  The only limitation is the ability of the owner to build sufficient infrastructure to put it to work. 

Think about a new drug that cures every kind of cancer. Now imagine that we ALL have cancer. The stock of pharmaceutical companies can go up thousands of percent overnight if you are there on the day that the breakthrough is discovered.  That’s how you have to think about AI, but it’s nit just curing cancer (and it WILL do that), it’s curing every illness and disease known and unknown, it is automating everything, it will simplify attainment and use of logic and knowledge in all aspects of our lives. As the hardware becomes better and more efficient and everything is using it and it is all tied together, it will be even more efficient and effective. 

So, you’re paying 40x earnings?  In the next 5-10 years earnings will be 1000x what they are today for a company like NVIDIA. Ownership is almost priceless, there’s no “Bubble”, they’ve discovered the cure for cancer and everything else; if it were a pharmaceutical company, the stock would have been up 10,000x by now.

I feel extremely ""guilty"" about saving up, knowing that at my age I sit in the 90th percentile of Net Worth by age.

I feel guilty 'cause I see people and friends my age or older struggling with money, while I sit here with a cushy job and enough savings to last me for years, money that would benefit them more than it would ever benefit me.

How do you cope with this feeling?

Thigns to consider:
- Paris is the most expensive place in France, and rent is terrible. If you are open to buy is a different thing. In general I would suggest to take a look of cheaper cities. I would suggest Lyon, but locals here will know the area better. (Maybe a village close to Paris?). This is the key point.
- You will need to speak French to work. The only alternative is to work remotely for the states or maybe UK. I don't think you need to speak perfectly, but you must be fluent at least.
- Your savings combine amount is something that the average person in Europe won't save in their life. So you are good in that aspect.
- For your wife salary, you will need to take a look of taxes and contract models, it works quite different and taxes might be different.
- just your wife's salary is enough for two, with saving and interest you should be fine even with kids.",Away_Negotiation4150,1,,,2025-10-10 16:17:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o2nlu2/can_we_afford_to_move_and_live_abroad_in_france/,https://reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1o2nlu2/can_we_afford_to_move_and_live_abroad_in_france/nirz5xm/

nirpyox,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Has anyone actually tried just buying whatever's trending here daily?,"I just had ChatGPT 5 pro run a backtest with the following rules:

If ""Ronald The Retard"" Reddit user woke up every morning for the past 6 years and bought every ""hot"" stock post on WallStreetBets subreddit, how much would he have spent out of pocket, and how much would he have gained or lost?

Rules:

1. If a stock is pimped out in a hot and rising post, Ronald spends $100 on the ticker, either an option or underlying.  If no target price is mentioned, he buys the underlying stock itself.  If a strike/expiration are mentioned, he buys at least one contract - as many as he can for $100, or just a single contract if it's $100 or more.


2. If there are conflicting calls/put posts, Ronald buys the bullish one.  Once he's committed to either a call/put/or stock purchase, Ronald doesn't change strategy on that ticker until it falls out of being mentioned in hot/rising posts for at least a week. For example, if Ronald buys puts on a ticker, and the next day he sees two posts about that same ticker: one pimping calls, the other pimping puts, Ronald buys more puts, but calls will have to wait until next time the ticker comes into hot/rising after it falls out.


3. Ronald always sells options contracts 3/4 of the way to expiration, and he sells stock after 1 week.


The answer is long, but the takeaway is that Ronald  would have cycled $1.5M into the system out of pocket, and at the end of it he would have lost an average of $34k per week, or $10,608,000.

A highly regarded strategy indeed.",Dracolique,2,,,2025-10-10 15:29:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o26eek/has_anyone_actually_tried_just_buying_whatevers/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o26eek/has_anyone_actually_tried_just_buying_whatevers/nirpyox/

nirkna2,comment,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Considering puts on meme stocks,"The idea isn’t dumb but the structure is very naive. You’re right that high-beta junk names implode faster in a correction, but the real problem is *how you finance the protection.*

Buying 1–1.5y puts on speculative stocks is brutally expensive per unit of hedge. IVs are already sky-high, so you’ll bleed a lot while waiting for a crash that... may never come. The trick is to structure or finance the hedge instead of just buying outright.

One approach is a calendar: own the 1y puts, sell longer-dated ones to reduce carry. Or, to align better with your thesis, find names likely to fall less in a selloff and sell puts there to offset the bleed.

If you want to build intuition, think of it this way; you’re long volatility on the trash, so you want to be short vol somewhere more stable. Selling index puts to finance the junk is one practical way to do it.

1o2zf8d,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","**TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).

As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.

Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.

Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.



# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case

* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*
* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:

This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense.

This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of.

Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline.

# 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain

After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls.

The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**.

This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more.

The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone.

In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate.

What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af.



# 🔬Testing My Theory

If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies.

AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started.

And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing.



# 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis

The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout.

There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing.

With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event.

After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀

1o2yw0m,post,stocks,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,In praise of Verizon.,"Due to a CEO change VZ recently dipped. And I bought it. Here's why.

Verizon is a cash earning machine. PE under 10 on a  172B market cap. FCF was 19B in 2024 and 18.7B in 2023. That's **with** it's capex build out on 5g - which is largely done now. That's **with** it's massive debt payments. Factored in. Which brings me to VZ's weakness - and then my thesis. 

Verizon's weakness is it's unholy debt. Look it up yourself for it gives me shudders to simply mention the number. Why is the share price so low for such a cash juggernaut? The debt.

Verizon also has limited growth prospects. But to compensate it has limited decline dangers. It's one of a 3 player oligopoly over American communications connectivity. And that demand be inelastic. High floor low ceiling. Who cares with it's FCF numbers. Nay - not growth not growth - but debt is what keeps the share price down. 

Now about that debt.

My thesis is the dollar is in danger. Recession isn't the threat. Inflation is. So now students ...

What does inflation do to debt?

And what does it do to dollar denominated profits?

You're looking at gold in disguise. VZ

1o2xukt,post,investing,MC.PA,LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE,Opinions on investment mix for newly retired.,"Trying this again since my previous post was too fund-specific. Retired a little under three years ago, and was hoping to get some (constructive) opinions on my current account diversification. I am of the opinion that the market is due for a sizable correction that will lead to a stagflation scenario. To that end I diversified seven months ago into a “first step” mix that I think will, with further adjustments, stand up in that future scenario. I have one year’s worth of expenses in a HYSA separately. I pull mainly from Roth contributions and 457b currently. The percentages are a bit wonky; I haven’t rebalanced yet. Can I get your take on it’s current state?

Top Level: 84% Equity, 8% Bonds, 5% Cash, 3% Gold

ROTH: 82% Equity, 12% Bonds, 6% Gold. 60% Domestic, 20% Int’l, 20% Global. 63% LC, 2% MC, 10% SC, 7% EM, 12% Fixed, 6% Other. 71% Blend, 5% Value, 6% Growth, 12% Bond, 6% Other. Bonds 58% Mixed, 42% Treasury

IRA: 77% Equity, 17% Bonds, 6% Gold. 72% Domestic, 22% Int’l, 6% Global. 60% LC, 5% MC, 6% SC, 6% EM, 17% Fixed, 6% Other. 53% Blend, 9% Value, 10% Sector, 5% Growth, 17% Bond, 6% Other. Bonds 65% Mixed, 35% Treasury

457b: 92% Equity, 8% Cash. 58% Domestic, 34% Int’l, 8% Other. 82% LC, 10% EM, 8% Other. 92% Blend, 8% Other. 

403b: 86% Equity, 4% Bonds, 10% Cash. 53% Domestic, 37% Int’l, 10% Other. 69% LC, 13% EM, 4% SC, 4% Fixed, 10% Other. 82% Blend, 4% Value, 4% Bond, 10% Other. Bonds 50% Mixed, 50% Corporate.

Up front, my thoughts are to increase bonds via TIPS or Short-Term, and perhaps Gold. My 457/403b options are limited though as it’s employer-sponsored. Thank you for any helpful advice.

* Then China started publically pushing companies to buy local GPU´s
* Then China´s Antitrust authority accuses Nvidia of violating merger conditions
* NVIDIA started saying they don´t consider any earnings or projections for China for the forseeable future at last quartly reports

**Result:** Either black market through Singapore or others are blooming and everybody looks away or china is truely not buying more.

Bonjour à toutes et à tous, Je me permets de demander des conseils ou orientations pour une personne très proche qui vit actuellement à Paris. Je vis à l’étranger et j’essaie de la soutenir à distance, mais la situation devient vraiment difficile.

Elle a travaillé pendant 4 ans comme nounou et femme de ménage chez une famille à Paris — sans papiers. Elle a récemment perdu son emploi via une rupture conventionnelle. Elle dispose de fiches de paie, mais elle se retrouve aujourd’hui sans revenu, sans emploi, sans couverture médicale et avec un loyer à payer.

Elle a déposé une demande de titre de séjour en août, et elle est maintenant en attente d’une réponse. En attendant, elle cherche activement du travail, mais c’est extrêmement compliqué sans papiers. On lui a dit que sans titre de séjour, elle ne peut pas bénéficier de certaines aides.

Elle a du mal financially à accéder à des besoins de base comme la nourriture et les soins médicaux ( Medcine general ect..) Elle est courageuse et fait de son mieux, mais être sans papiers, seule, et sans emploi à Paris, c’est très dur. Je ne veux pas qu’elle tombe dans l’oubli.

Elle ne sait pas que je poste ici, mais je suis simplement une fille très inquiète qui essaie de faire ce qu’elle peut. Connaissez-vous des associations, services ou aides locales qui pourraient l’aider (conseil juridique, soutien alimentaire, aide sociale, pistes d’emploi, etc.) ? Même une petite info serait précieuse ,ou si vous connaissez des personnes qui pourraient la guider.

Elle a déjà essayé de demander une aide sociale, mais on lui a répondu qu’il fallait avoir un titre de séjour pour y accéder. Actuellement, elle va essayer de faire une demande d’aide médicale cover, 
. Elle n’a pas encore contacté La Cimade, mais elle y pense sérieusement.

Retourner dans son pays d’origine n’est pas une option actuellement, pour des raisons financières et personnelles. Elle est venue en France pour essayer de construire une vie meilleure, et j’aimerais juste qu’elle puisse garder la tête hors de l’eau pendant cette période difficile.

Merci infiniment pour toute aide ou conseil

Hi everyone, I’m reaching out to ask for any advice, support, or orientation that could help a loved one of mine living in Paris. I’m currently overseas and trying to support her from afar, but the situation is becoming really heavy.

She worked for 4 years as a live-in nanny and cleaner for a family in Paris,all while undocumented. She recently lost her job under a rupture conventionnelle, and although she has her payslips, she’s now left with no income, no job, no medical coverage, and rent to pay.

She has already submitted her application for a titre de séjour (residency permit) back in August, and she’s now waiting for a response. In the meantime, she’s trying to find work, but it’s incredibly difficult without papers. She’s been told by some places that without the residency permit, she can’t get certain types of help.

Right now, she’s struggling finically to get access to basic needs like food and healthcare. She’s very resourceful and resilient, she’s trying everything she can. But being undocumented, alone, and unemployed in Paris is really tough, and I just don’t want her to fall through the cracks.

She doesn’t know I’m posting, but I’m just a very concerned daughter doing what I can. Would anyone here know of any local organisations or services that could help her (legal advice, food support, social aid, employment leads, etc.)? Even something small would be incredibly helpful- or if you know people in the area who might be able to guide her.

Returning to her home country isn’t an option right now due to financial and personal reasons. She moved to France in hopes of building a better life, and I just want to help her stay afloat while she’s navigating this difficult time.

Thanks so much for your help  !!",berrybroke1357,0,0.29,2.0,2025-10-10 12:24:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o2x5n3/guidesoutien_recherché_pour_une_proche_sans/,https://reddit.com/r/france/comments/1o2x5n3/guidesoutien_recherché_pour_une_proche_sans/

niqw5kk,comment,stocks,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Oct 10, 2025","A common phrase is that ""everyone is a genius in a bull market"" and there is something to the concept but if you're beating the market you're beating the market. You could also easily not be beating the market - for all the things that are going up every day there are parts of the market that are not doing well.  You could have made a big, mis-timed options bet on something popular and wound up as one of the loss porn posts on r/wallstreetbets rather than beating the market. 

As I said in another thread, there are about 400 names that are technically oversold with an RSI 30 or less - while we're about at all time highs, there are a fair amount of things that are not. A lot of healthcare has had a lousy time.  A fair amount of CPG names have done mediocre/poorly lately and something like SFM has gone from (an admittedly pricey) growth story to down 45% in three months. The private equity names have turned decidedly lower. I'm a little surprised travel has held up as well as it has. 

I do think that when you look at the stuff that goes up every day and one starts to feel like you could close your eyes and point to a stock in the hottest parts of the market and do well that's a concern. When investing feels very easy that isn't a top but it's a point where it's time to start to be a *little* cautious. It can go on waaaaaaay longer than anyone expects, but there's been two instances in the very recent past (2022, early 2025) where the escalator up turned into an elevator down and people who were 110% risk-on because it was ""growth stocks only go up"" for months on end had no option really but to de-risk. 

If the markets are escalator up (2020/21, 2023/24, post low 2025) and elevator down (2H21/22, early 2025) the problem becomes the rise is compelling enough and goes on for long enough that people become complacent and invest as if the escalator up will never have a ceiling - this is what your friend is talking about when warning about being overly optimistic. 

People in 2020/21 were talking about ""this time is different"" and there was a lot of discussion on here about people piling into ARK funds and then there was 2022. In terms of ARKK, it's up 65% YTD and still negative over the last 5 years because of how badly she did post 2020 bubble. ARK was the hottest fund company in 2020/21 yet 21.7B in realized losses last year because of things she didn't sell including a 1.5B loss on TDOC alone.  In the dot com boom there was Janus Twenty. In 2020 there was ARKK. 

""That you could throw darts at a dartboard with companies in the dark, at random, and still come out in the positive.""

A lot of AI/data center related or even ""sort of adjacent"" names feel like this to me. In 2020, pretty much all of growth felt like this. 

For me, I've been trimming popular stuff lately because with how much I'm up off the low of about 6 months ago I know that's very likely unsustainable - I just don't see repeating the performance of the last 6 months over the next 6 so it's to a point where I'm satisfied and want to try to actively at least try to protect the gains a little.  Could certainly be wrong, but again I'm not dumping every hot stock, simply dialing down exposure to what's worked incredibly well over the last 6 months/YTD.",dvdmovie1,5,,,2025-10-10 11:55:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/niqw5kk/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

SCHD is a large cap value fund. Comparing large cap value to any other style box (large cap growth, small cap value) is equivalent to comparing apples to oranges. 

Yes many own SCHD for the dividends, but many also own it as the LCV fund portion of a multi fund strategy. 

Different style boxes trend in different market environments. One should not expect LCG and LCV to trend simultaneously.

nipkql8,comment,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Why I'm long Kodiak AI Warrants (KDK),"Here is an ai summary on how warrants work and how they apply to kodiak. Hope this helps

Strike Price Mechanics
The strike price, also known as the exercise price, for KDK W public warrants is fixed at $11.50 per share of Kodiak AI common stock (KDK), allowing holders to purchase one share at this predetermined price upon exercise. This mechanism provides leveraged exposure to the underlying stock's appreciation above $11.50, where the intrinsic value equals the difference between the current market price and the strike (e.g., if KDK trades at $15, exercising yields $3.50 profit per warrant before fees), but results in no value if the stock price remains below the strike at expiration. Warrants become exercisable starting 30 days after the September 23, 2025 merger closing, approximately October 23, 2025, and include cashless exercise options to avoid direct payment of the strike under certain conditions.​

Expiration and Timeframe
KDKRW warrants expire on September 25, 2030, providing a total term of five years from the merger closing date when the original AACT warrants converted into Kodiak warrants. As of October 9, 2025, approximately 4 years and 11 months remain until expiration, during which holders can exercise if the stock price exceeds the strike. Early redemption may occur if KDK shares trade above $18 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days, forcing cash settlement at the lower of $0.01 or (stock price minus strike), potentially limiting upside for long-term holders.​",adoptedschitt,3,,,2025-10-10 04:56:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2nzzj/why_im_long_kodiak_ai_warrants_kdk/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2nzzj/why_im_long_kodiak_ai_warrants_kdk/nipkql8/

But if the deal with OpenAI isn't ""showing strength in AMD's GPU department,"" then I don't know what is. Sure they sweetened the pot for OpenAI quite a bit, but no matter how you slice it, OpenAI must consider AMD's GPUs to be at least remotely competent. It's also a concrete instance of them taking market share from NVDA. It's 6 gigawatts that NVDA could be providing, but isn't. AMD has a foot in the door. That's the bottom line. NVDA's valuation relies on the assumption that no one else on earth is selling a single AI chip.",thrololololowaway,1,,,2025-10-10 04:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/niphlri/

1o2op9m,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,$200k in FLY - Reusable Rocket Chairman Kim TA - $50+ Recovery,"I was looking for RKLB and SpaceX competitors, and I found Fly or Firefly Aerospace, a new rocket company building reusable Medium-Lift Rockets with Northrop Grumman and the US governments.

This piqued my interest because anything Space and Rocket go up right? Turned out not to be true.

Firefly actually went down, and over 50%, so I looked at why by drawing the TA.

Recently Japan has been doing good, and then that sea of red looked like an inverse Japan flag. The flag is typically White with a Red dot but no, this graph was Red with a White Dot. So, when you plot the inverse Nihon flag over the graph, it all made sense why it went down 50%+ since IPO. 

But around this price at $30 where the flag ended. I also saw a meme of Chairman Kim on X, and then I put his photo over the edge, and the price went down probably because of him. So it all made sense.

But, from my new knowledge about Space and  Rockets, even if they go down, they must go back up because they're reusable? I also learned they had the medium lift rockets in 2026 and 2026 isn't too far away and that they're going to the moon again with Nasa.

Because of this insight and because I like rockets, I realized that $FLY will head back $50+ to the moon and I bought $200k+ worth of shares.

1o2nzzj,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Why I'm long Kodiak AI Warrants (KDK),"Kodiak AI makes ai programs that help big trucks drive themselves. Unlike some other companies still testing their ideas, Kodiak AI’s self-driving trucks are already on the road proving they work safely and reliably in both military and commercial settings.

In September 2025, Kodiak AI and its partner Roush showed the first fully driverless truck powered by Kodiak’s software. This truck drove on public roads, handled traffic, and stayed safe without a human driver. That’s a big step beyond just testing in closed areas. They also have military and frac trucks working with an order for 100 new frac trucks from their oilfield partner atlas.

[https://kodiak.ai/news/the-first-truck-was-delivered-to-kodiak-customer-a](https://kodiak.ai/news/the-first-truck-was-delivered-to-kodiak-customer-a)

Kodiak AI also has strong money support. Big investors like ARK Invest and Soros Fund Management are quietly buying Kodiak shares. It's rare to see Cathy and George Soros together as Soros is more of a value investor.

[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/soros-fund-management-takes-57-passive-stake-in-kodiak-ai/ar-AA1NHBj8](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/soros-fund-management-takes-57-passive-stake-in-kodiak-ai/ar-AA1NHBj8)

Because Kodiak AI is already making money, has paying customers, and keeps proving its technology, its a good bet on AI in trucking. It currently sells for less than Aurora innovations, and seems to be much further along in terms of commercializing its technology.

I prefer the warrants as they are still relatively cheap at 1.25. If this stock runs to 15 or 20, the warrants are a 5 to 10x. The company has had a strong bounce since Soros and Woods position was announced.

We currently live in Austin, TX and have lived here for the past 10 years but we are now at the stage of wanting to settle down and start a family. This city is great but from a long term perspective, we don't envision ourselves here. We're now entertaining a move to Paris since my wife feels more comfortable being close to family if we were to have children. However, from my basic research, it's clear there are some huge things to consider with this decision (ex, finding a new job w/ language barrier in mind, a drastic cut in incomes, taxes, etc.).

The biggest concern is financial. I have no clue what it's like to live / work / raise children in France and there is a huge likelihood that my current employer will NOT be ok with me working abroad as I work in Sales and am required to go in-office 5 days a week. I guess I'd like to know, with our current savings and retirement accounts, how long could we last in Paris if in worst case scenario, I'm not ever able to find a job? (I know this is highly unlikely but I'd like to get some honest perspectives on this scenario). Luckily, my wife's job is secure and transferrable so her income will still be there. She will likely be making around € 70,000 annually. We ideally want 1-2 kids in the next 5 years or so.

I'd generally like to know how financially secure or insecure should I feel with the above in mind? With our current networth, are we able to live just off my wife's income? We have a middle class lifestyle, we spend pretty responsibly and don't purchase things we can't afford.

1o2n09o,post,StockMarket,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,$OPEN: Why I think next earnings call will be disastrous (a follow-up to my dilution post).,"Context for the dilution post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqq6by/massive\_open\_dilution\_incoming\_october\_1\_seems/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqq6by/massive_open_dilution_incoming_october_1_seems/)

Now, I'll admit, when I made that post I hadn't quite deep dived into things and was looking for more clarification from other users out of curiosity.  I am realizing now that my post might have made it sound like October 1 was going to be some kind of doomsday.  I wanted to make a follow-up post to update on some things I have learned since and why I think things are still extremely bearish for Opendoor (outside of the profit and macro issues which most people are aware of already I think).

I will preface this by saying that what I have learned has been through reading filings, tracking data, talking to others more knowledgeable than me but I still may not have fully accurate info.

What I will say is that it is abundantly clear by all interpretations I look in to that the 207M convertible notes are very much eligible for conversion as of October 1.  I don't have any doubt about that as everything I look in to confirms this is the case, especially when poring over the wording of the filing.

The other thing that is clear to me is that at the current price Opendoor is at, there is NO logical reason whatsoever not to convert (whether to cover a short position OR to sell at mass profit).  Anyone arguing otherwise...I have yet to hear a convincing argument.  ESPECIALLY when the notes were issued when Opendoor was under a dollar.

What I did NOT know when I made my previous post are the following things:

1. Notes are NOT converted automatically.  A conversion request can be made and Opendoor has 4 trading days (to the best of my knowledge though this could be wrong) to consider the request and either issue shares or settle with cash.  Given Opendoor's financial situation, it only makes sense to settle with shares.  This means, that a conversion request occurring on October 1 would not ""immediately"" become an added share to the float the same day.  I feel many people misunderstood this part.  In addition to this, it would make no sense for note holders to convert and sell/cover 207M in a single freaking day.  That would obliterate the stock price and ruin their own profit on the notes.
2. I've learned that note conversion DOES NOT require an immediate SEC filing.  In addition, free float counts reflected in market data DO NOT get updated without a filing.  This is important here because previously, I thought one would be able to see the float or share count increasing as this conversion was occurring.  Thus, the only time we will see the impact on the float of conversion FOR SURE...is the next 10-Q...earnings day.
3. I've noticed some weird activity with Opendoor's shares available to short since I started monitoring it October 1.  What was odd about that day (but could be total coincidence) is that I noticed shares available to short jump significantly AFTER which, a mini rally of the price occurred...which was then soon quashed.  Coincidentally, we learned later that day AH that the ex-CFO has sold a block of his shares during that rally.

Since then (as I've been watching it), I've noticed interesting price movement such that shares available to short jumps....the stock rallies AFTER....shares available to short jumps back down, stock falls soon after.

Now I THINK this might be related to exit liquidity activity (ie. selling converted notes).  Some notes need to be used to cover shorts, some to sell for profit.  So I think short covering is occurring to spark a rally to sell converted notes into.  Maybe it's a just a conspiracy theory though.

4. Interestingly, starting October 6 (around the time when note conversion requests would start becoming actual shares), we have seen some pretty crazy activity with massive spikes being pummeled right down, sometimes almost instantaneously.  I believe this is a combination of the short covering and conversion selling occurring in tandem.

5. The short share borrow rate has been falling each day, even on rally days. Even though the short interest has been steady.  While this could be for various reasons, I think it is likely because supply of available shares to short is increasing each day (dilution).

Given this ""theory"" (and let's face it, it is just that)...I am curious what impact this plays on the stock price leading IN to earnings because clearly insiders AND note holders know if conversions are going on and should act accordingly.  But I also wonder what happens when other shareholders suddenly see the float potentially jump by up to 207M shares on earnings day unexpectedly.  I can't imagine it would be good.  Thoughts?

PS: ""But Eric Wu bought shares!!!!!"".....yes, under an agreement that diluted the float since he didn't open market buy and at a price of $6.65...well below market...

Just an aside, but I'd also like to point out that mortgage and real estate data has been showing a softening trend since earlier in the year, and I can't help but think that doesn't help for next earnings date as well",GoShogun,15,0.72,18.0,2025-10-10 02:49:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o2n09o/open_why_i_think_next_earnings_call_will_be/,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o2n09o/open_why_i_think_next_earnings_call_will_be/

1o2mnm4,post,investing,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,Suppose we're not in an AI Bubble,"Just for a moment, suppose that all valuations are justified and all the US mega cap tech companies are gonna match earnings growth expectations. At current valuation, that roughly translates to an average return for investors. But maybe they all slightly **outperform** expectations and bring investors another 5-10 years of US equity outperformance too

Fast forward those 5-10 years. Here's my question to you... Was it worth the risk? It might not be obvious whether we're in an AI bubble right now. But what **is** obvious (at least to me) is that we've entered a moment in history where the market is experiencing **extreme correlation**

With each new announcement of this or that multi-billion dollar contract between tech companies, index funds are losing their diversification. Any prudent investor knows their goal is not to maximize total return but to optimize **risk-adjusted** returns. I'm just gonna say right now that these mega caps ain't it

If you truly want higher returns, the way to do it would be to leverage up a risk-adjusted optimal portfolio rather than hold highly concentrated positions in a few mega caps which have done amazingly well in recent years

My advice? For any random year, I'd say just go with VT to get global diversification. But in this current moment of extreme correlation, I'd say go with AVGE to get global diversification but with a value tilt which effectively underweights the US mega caps

Edit: I will only be responding to relevant comments. Again, this post is **not** about whether the market will go up or down, but rather the tradeoff between future expected returns and recent increase in concentration risk.

nioflbj,comment,investing,AAPL,Apple Inc.,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"There are two complicating factors right now. One is there is very little institutional shorting. Shorting is necessary for accurate price discovery. The other is share repurchases. Or the degree of share repurchases.

Onto your question, share repurchases provide buoyancy. Apple for example paid out more in share repurchases last quarter than the the company earned. That is from memory maybe it was the previous quarter.

Share Repurchases also can happen off market so that if anyone wants to sell the company can just prevent that selling pressure. 

Without institutions shorting what you have is only retail shorting stocks and the company buying shares which forces a rolling retail short squeeze. This is why the entire market is up since 2020 essentially. Just a prolonged retail short squeeze. This is an over simplification. PODs and algo shops are learning the patterns and magnifying this effect. Option writers/market makers are also using the volatility as well.

Just remember, no one has to  a *buy a s*tock for it to go.

Just one person has to be caught short and need to cover.

""In addition, cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for employee stock option and purchase plans. The buyback program has not kept pace with employee stock option grants or exercises. Beginning in fiscal 1990, Microsoft has repurchased 710 million common shares while 1.79 billion shares were issued under the Company’s employee stock option and purchase plans. The market value of all outstanding stock options was $69 billion as of June 30, 1999. Microsoft enhances its repurchase program by selling put warrants. During December 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible exchangeable preferred stock. Net proceeds of $980 million were used to repurchase common shares. In December 1999, each preferred share is convertible into common shares or an equivalent amount of cash determined by a formula that provides a floor price of $79.875 and a cap of $102.24 per preferred share, equivalent to $19.97 and $25.56 per common share.""

From 1996-1999, they repurchased $980 million.

[https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar99/mdna.htm](https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar99/mdna.htm)

There was $1T in share repurchases last year.  As the free float decreases the affect of decreasing liquidity is not linear.  So buying back shares for the last decade has created an entirely different mechanic than in 1999.

Over the past 15 years, we’ve looked at all 145 public companies that came out after the 2008 financial crisis and found some interesting trends:

⁠Companies that came out after pre-packaged bankruptcies did much worse than the average.

• For three years after the crisis, the financials sector didn’t see any new public companies.

• ⁠Stocks in the materials sector did really well in the three years after the crisis compared to other sectors.

• Energy companies had a much higher Debt/Market Cap ratio when they first appeared than companies in other sectors.

• On average, companies that went bankrupt during the 2008-11 period and then went public showed the best stock performance over three years, based on CAGR, across all the time periods we looked at.",justaregulargye,5,0.78,3.0,2025-10-09 22:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2gvpl/analysis_of_145_post2008_ipos_shows_firms_that/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2gvpl/analysis_of_145_post2008_ipos_shows_firms_that/

1o2gfpp,post,investing,CAP.PA,Capgemini SE,PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025,"
With all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today. I also included the rate of return through 2006, so this avoids the 2007–08 crash.

Take this for what you will.

 

Notable:

Average P/E in 1999: 54
Average P/E in 2025: 48
4 Companies from 1999 had a positive return through 2006. 
5 companies from 1999 are still in the top 20 today: Exxon, Walmart, Microsoft, J&J, and Oracle
In 1999, 3 companies had P/Es over 100. Today, only Tesla is above 100.
Tesla stands out with the highest PE of the 40 data points and continues to confound me.

nimmt72,comment,dividends,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,I’ve got $500K to invest — what would you buy for a long-term dividend portfolio?,"Sure but the companies in a dividend fund have underlying assets and businesses that theoretically should grow at or exceeding the rate of inflation

So a CD will return 4% but then you lose 2.5% to inflation

A dividend fund returns 2.5% and should index to inflation each year (or more)

So that’s the first part, the real hope though is it grows more then inflation. A lot of good dividend funds with reasonable yield (2.5-3.5%)  have seen dividends grow 5-10% a year for decades.",TRichard3814,2,,,2025-10-09 19:17:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o29oan/ive_got_500k_to_invest_what_would_you_buy_for_a/,https://reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o29oan/ive_got_500k_to_invest_what_would_you_buy_for_a/nimmt72/

1o2b1hk,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,What to Invest in with a Joint Account?,"Hi All, 

Looking on some ideas/advice of where to invest in a joint account with my wife. 

Little Background. 

My wife has a 401k through her employer

I have a state pension and a Roth IRA that I invest heavily into VOO and I have a large chunk of NVDA, some Amazon, MSFT, and a little PEG.

My Wife and I are saving upwards of $4k every month and I want to take a chunk of that and invest in a joint account so our money works for us a little more.

Do I just invest in more VOO or do invest in a different ETF, go Dividend heavy, or something else all together? 

I feel like VOO would be ok but that doesn't give us much diversity in our portfolio. 

What would you do? 

Thanks all! ",AntiMatter89,2,0.67,5.0,2025-10-09 18:44:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2b1hk/what_to_invest_in_with_a_joint_account/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2b1hk/what_to_invest_in_with_a_joint_account/

1o29uqr,post,options,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,"I want to play KVUE - is this a bottoming out and rebound, or is it stagnant?","Listen up! This isn't one of those hot AI or semiconductor stocks. Lately, I've been keeping an eye on KVUE (Kenvue)—the consumer products company spun off from Johnson & Johnson, which owns established products like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine, and Band-Aid. Since its IPO, the stock has been hammered, plummeting from over $24 to just over $15. But now, it seems the decline was severely overdone. All the bad news—the Tylenol lawsuit, slowing sales, inflationary pressures, and a rising dollar—is already priced into the stock, and institutions have largely shunned it.



But now the trend is starting to get interesting. The stock rebounded around $15.4 and is currently consolidating between $16.5 and $17. The MACD has turned positive, the RSI has rebounded from its oversold zone, and the candlestick chart has retraced back above the middle Bollinger Band. If it can hold above $17.2, there's a chance it could reach $19 in the short term. I'm not saying this stock will take off, but if it rebounds 10–15%, with the right options, the profit potential is quite attractive.



I'm looking at medium-term call options (such as 17.5 or 20 call options expiring in January or June 2026). Implied volatility (IV) is currently quite low, and since no one is paying attention to this stock, the premium is cheap. This stock is suitable for a slow-grinding rebound, or even a short-term surge if there's short covering. You can also use a wheel strategy. After all, the fundamentals are solid, the dividend is 5%, and selling put options on a dip to collect the premium is also a good option.



Personally, I'm curious if this stock has more potential, or if I should just stay flat. The risk/reward ratio is quite attractive right now—there's not much room for downside, and the rebound is decent, assuming there's no new bad news.



Is anyone else watching KVUE lately? What's your approach—LEAPS, selling PUTs, or just rolling the wheel?

But like if you set up some system that said what ever stocks were trending that day you purchased 10 shares of and sold when the hype died down. Or something along those lines.

1o27ng5,post,stocks,NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation,"Intel gives first look at next-gen chips, says Arizona fab is fully operational","Intel on Thursday announced its new PC chips slated to debut in laptops next year as the chipmaker battles to turn around its struggling business.

The company said the new Panther Lake processor is made with its 18A technology and is the most advanced node made on U.S. soil.

The new generation of chips will be made at Intel’s Fab 52 facility in Arizona, which the company said is now fully operational and set to ramp production.

“The United States has always been home to Intel’s most advanced R&D, product design and manufacturing – and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,” CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a release announcing the news.

Intel’s latest reveal comes during a critical stretch for the beleaguered chipmaker that has lagged in recent years and struggled to keep up with cutting-edge chip demands spurred by the artificial intelligence revolution.

In August, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in the company in an effort to beef up U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.

Since taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.

This summer, President Donald Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.

Intel shares have bounced 87% this year.

He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

1o26eek,post,wallstreetbets,OR.PA,L'Oréal SA,Has anyone actually tried just buying whatever's trending here daily?,"Been thinking about this and it sounds dumb but also maybe not?

Like every day there's some stock that blows up on here. Could be earnings play, some random DD that gets everyone hyped, or just meme momentum. And yeah there's always a few guys who post their gains afterward.

But what if you just... did that? Wake up, check what's hot, throw a bit of money at it, set a stop loss maybe?

I feel like by the time I see a post with 5k upvotes the move is already over. But then sometimes shit keeps running for days.

Has anyone tracked this? Even just paper trading it? Because either this is the dumbest idea ever or there's something to it and I can't tell which.

Also yeah I know ""inverse WSB"" but that's a meme right? We can't be wrong ALL the time.

Anyway if you've actually tried this let me know how it went. Did you make money or just lose it in new and exciting ways?

Once again, I hope you are all enjoying the crispy tendies of my previous 4 posts... BITF, PSKY, SKYT, CRSP... Behold, hot off the presses this morning is an update from PayPal. Yes, that PayPal, the one you stopped using in 2013. 

**Spicy options flow hitting the tape.**

* For starters, the call option flow has been truly absurd. Tens of millions of dollars in very near-dated calls, many of them max strike. Many more in the form of way OTM LEAPs. Something’s brewing. This could come soon, or near earnings on 10/28.

**PayPay updated privacy statement**

* Well this morning, I got an email from PayPal about updates to their privacy statement. You probably got it too. And yes, I actually read it. Lo and behold they have a new section about how your data will be used for Agentic AI. ChatGPT told me this is the first time they have called it out so plainly in a privacy statement. The fintwit chatter has been speculating about an integration deal with a major LLM. Maybe agentic Venmo or PayPal checkout experience. They may be right.
