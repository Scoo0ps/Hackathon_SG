1o8oydh,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Can Brokerages Share/Sell Your Trading Data?,"Hi all,
my apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.

I've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since. Over the last ~6 years I've regularly bought SPY & VTI, and some AAPL, GOOGL, AMD, MSFT, NET, companies i am passionate about and follow intently. 

last week, i transfered some cash into my trading account and decided to disperse it evenly amongst SPY, VTI, and SCHD. Ever since, my Google News feed has been sharing nonstop reports about SCHD from websites like Seeking Alpha, Tipranks, etc... everyday, front and center in the ""For You"" panel. 

I am 100% certain i have done nothing to search, research, talk, text, or do anything inbetween to discuss this beyond just clicking the ""order"" button in the Schwab app once. 

So, how the F does google know about my recent purchase?",cornelius_cumquat,8,0.79,11,2025-10-17 04:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/
1o8cw2k,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline (most people are focusing on interest rate cuts, but ignoring this fatal truth)","The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month, but Powell's statement last night is the real bombshell, signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction. Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.

Balance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults. When the Fed sells mortgage bonds, it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings. When it sells Treasury bonds, corporate bond issuance costs also rise. This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity, which requires closer scrutiny. History always repeats itself. On the eve of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn't stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero. Ultimately, it was the initiation of Q1, or reverse balance sheet reduction, that stabilized the financial system. In his speech yesterday, Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets. This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019, when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10%, nearly shutting down Wall Street. He's clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake, and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment. On the surface, the US stock market is still rising, but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants, which together account for over 32% of the S&P 500's weighting. The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium-sized businesses are struggling with financing costs. This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate, but the patient's hands and feet are already cold. Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy. Even more subversive, halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic. When the Fed expands its balance sheet again, it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar. This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash. He didn't rush to cut interest rates back then, but instead directly injected liquidity into the market, successfully stemming the spread of the crisis. Powell's approach is now precisely the same. For businesses, this is an even more life-or-death situation. The Treasury Department issues $1 trillion in bonds every quarter. If the Fed stops selling them, it effectively lowers the government's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, giants like Apple and Microsoft, with $800 billion in cash on hand, will be in for a rude awakening. Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash, and the money they hold is quietly evaporating. So, when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts, remember the deeper meaning behind Powell's move, as quoted by Dave Reifsner, Director of Research at the Federal Reserve.

A famous governance maxim: When interest rates hit rock bottom, the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon. This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game. Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight; halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall. This move today will undoubtedly upset some. But it must be said. In the financial world, the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay. Remember, on the night of October 15, 2025, when history turns, some will hear only the wind, while others will see the shape of the storm. Now it's your turn. Are you one of the 97% who are focused on interest rate cuts, or the 11% who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction?

Is the top of this Pyramid Nvidia? 

Nvidia invests in companies like CoreWeave and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and these companies in turn, buy chips from Nvidia for their operations. Nvidia has also partnered with and invested in other companies like Intel and OpenAI, and is a major chip supplier for companies like Microsoft and Meta. 

Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, and in return, OpenAI is buying Nvidia systems for its data centers.

Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel and is partnering with it to develop new chips. Intel also buys Nvidia chips for some of its own products and services

Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.

1o4qj1w,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Trump will surrender face to China again ...,"Hi everyone,

  
China got a big monopoly on rare earth, they got 70% of the world reserve, and some exist only in China. Moreover, the piece of the process (refining) is under control of China at 90% of rare metal. Indeed, Western countries decided in 80's to abandon the sector and relocate it to China, because it's expensive and very polluting. So, China decide to develop this activity thank to their advantaged place. Everyone was happy because that was cheap and the western land were not polluted by this activity.

But, now, China is tired to see Western Countries spend some effort to ruin them. Today, they don't want to see US bulding the army with their own REE against them. The fact is US can't say ""we gonna f:ck China"" and ""ok we gonna make a deal"". China wants a real deal, that means the end of tech ban, and the end of offensive policy of US against them. In may/june, Trump was very kind after the deal, ""yes we fight China but friendly"". In the fact, US gov took some decision against Chine, pushing them to ban ree export : Nvidia H20 with killswitch to control their IT infrastructure, tax on chinese ship ... US didn't respect the deal and the process of negociating.

Trump threat with tariff. It's not ""no effect"", but China is a country with a mission. They live to be the first, not to get an iphone and 10000 followers on instagram or of. So they don't care about the rest if that save the interest of the state. Some companies lost millions every months cause of the ban, and CCP doesn't care ... 

Trump knows 100% of tariff on China is : laptop, tv, consummer hight tech with a double price. Are you ready to buy your Hp laptop for 2000 dollars instead 1000 dollars ?

But the big danger is REE. Today, US can't get them. They can but all the money they got to build fab and mines, it's impossible to meet the demand without chinese ree. In 2030, some REE demand will rise up to x6 cause of data center, defense, green energy and EV.

No REE = No data center, no Tesla, No Nvidia, no Apple, No amazon, no Microsoft ... Everything will stop.

1o2b1hk,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,What to Invest in with a Joint Account?,"Hi All, 

Looking on some ideas/advice of where to invest in a joint account with my wife. 

Little Background. 

My wife has a 401k through her employer

I have a state pension and a Roth IRA that I invest heavily into VOO and I have a large chunk of NVDA, some Amazon, MSFT, and a little PEG.

My Wife and I are saving upwards of $4k every month and I want to take a chunk of that and invest in a joint account so our money works for us a little more.

Do I just invest in more VOO or do invest in a different ETF, go Dividend heavy, or something else all together? 

I feel like VOO would be ok but that doesn't give us much diversity in our portfolio. 

What would you do? 

Thanks all! ",AntiMatter89,3,0.8,5,2025-10-09 18:44:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2b1hk/what_to_invest_in_with_a_joint_account/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2b1hk/what_to_invest_in_with_a_joint_account/

I’m considering switching from all ETFs in my Roth IRA to some Magnificent 7 stocks such as TSLA, NVDA, GOOGL, AAPL, META, MSFT. They would be all new holdings. Then I would write monthly covered calls to collect premiums as described in my table.

Upside $8k give or take monthly. Downsides some stocks get massive upside and I miss out on huge gains. Another downside is we hit 🐻territory and account value dumps, but I can still write CCs right, albeit with lower premiums available.

1o1ftxv,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,YOLO on $AI,"Pray for me.

EDIT: **DD: $AI (C3.ai) – Why I’m Bullish**

**Price Context:**  
Current Price: \~$19  
52-Week Range: $14.7 – $45

# 1️⃣ Strategic Partnerships Driving Growth

[C3.ai](http://C3.ai) has locked in some heavyweight partners that could accelerate enterprise adoption:

* **Microsoft**: Preferred enterprise AI partner – huge reach.
* **AWS & Google Cloud**: Strong cloud infrastructure + co-selling.
* **McKinsey QuantumBlack**: Combining AI expertise with consulting muscle – serious enterprise credibility.

These partnerships are not just logos; they’re pipeline multipliers.

# 2️⃣ Financial & Business Model Tailwinds

* **Subscription revenue = 86% of total revenue** → strong recurring cash flow.
* **Shift to consumption-based SaaS** → revenue scales with client usage, aligning incentives and improving financial stability.
* **Cash > Debt** → buffer against AI hype swings and market volatility.

Basically, the company has a runway to execute without burning out.

# 3️⃣ Market Opportunity

* Enterprise AI adoption is still in **early innings**.
* [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) targets **industry-specific AI apps**, not generic AI tools – harder to displace and sticky revenue.
* Big enterprise names trust their platform – the network effect matters.

# 4️⃣ Risk vs. Reward

* **Current Price = Lower risk entry point** (50%+ from 52-week high).
* Short-term execution hiccups exist (pilot conversions, margins), but these are normal growing pains in enterprise AI.
* CEO & leadership transitions could be uncertainty, but also opportunity if new strategies stick.

Bottom line: downside is somewhat contained at current valuations; upside is huge if enterprise AI adoption accelerates.

# 5️⃣ Why Now

* Price has already retraced massively → good risk/reward.
* Strategic partnerships & McKinsey deal signal **enterprise confidence**.
* Market volatility = opportunity for patient bulls.

**TL;DR:**  
[C3.ai](http://C3.ai) is a **low-risk entry** for bulls who believe in enterprise AI. Partnerships, recurring revenue, and consumption-based SaaS are strong tailwinds.

1o18pxg,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth,"Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***

The ticker? $PATH

And it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.

**What the fuck does PATH do?**

In short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. 

**Why is PATH so beaten up?**

It came too early… *just like you*, loser. 

PATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.

The nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) 

Since then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd

**Today is a completely different story**.

PATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity…. AI, robotics, and automation. They have weathered the storm of CEO change, and have established reliable income streams.

**2025 Partnerships:**

**As of October 2025, PATH has established new partnerships with:**

**Nvidia, OpenAI, Salesforce, and Snowflake. Yeah thats right, the motherfucking work horses of the modern market, NVDA and OPENAI**

This is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients: Microsoft, Google Cloud, SAP, and Amazon. 

**Earnings trends:** *PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row… and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings.* 

https://preview.redd.it/d8x0jx17ovtf1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e38c9aa90ea87072a1fe66d38c756b2a98dbe32

**What’s next?**

PATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth. The best part? Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships, meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December, and the market is *just now beginning to price that in.*

**TA / Options pricing - THIS IS BIG**

Bullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at $19. Resistance at 15, but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year, and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving, indicating big money is poised to capture the upside. 

***IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks, it’s currently sitting at 60-75%. This is HUGE. Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year.*** 

In comparison, other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141% for at the money, APLD 137%, SOUN 110%, RR 190%

*For you smooth brains, this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out.* 

Current short interest per fintel is 12%. Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge.

Since dropping to $10 a share, we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the $10-14 range, and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the $20's

It's just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it, bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement.

[Just like your mom, it's desperate to have it's gap filled](https://preview.redd.it/bh4w96fiqvtf1.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a8460f055ec3041c6e75824cc2ec74413ff3e6)

**Share ownership:** 76% of shares owned by institutions

**Ziptrader** (800k subs on youtube) made PATH his #1 pick

**My Position:** November, December, and January calls + shares. Planning to add more, as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks. I'm using my gambling account, and I got permission from my wife's boyfriend to use her account and start another position.

**TLDR: PATH is an established player in AI and Robotics, has signed major deals with NVDA, openAI, CRM, SNOW, and MSFT, but the stock price has not reflected their potential growth. PT: 50+**

  
**UPDATE: 10/15/2025**

Still Holding January Calls below, and shares. Will look to add to position again as market recovers:

1o15sk2,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles,"People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.

And recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

Not saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.

What do you guys think about this? Here's the link to the paper: [https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf)",PadfootProwler,479,0.94,134,2025-10-08 11:28:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/
1o0xdqd,post,options,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$MSFT unusual options activity,"Alright so check this out… Yesterday, someone just dropped over $18M on MSFT 525 puts expiring Nov 14. That’s 10,000+ contracts at an average of $17.58, which is wild considering that strike is way out of the money right now.

Now, I’m holding the 555 calls for Oct 17, so I’m still on the bullish side short-term, but this kind of flow definitely caught my eye. When you see that kind of premium size and open interest this low (OI only 12), that means these are new positions, not some roll-over. Somebody’s loading up for a possible pullback or they’re hedging size ahead of next month.

If you look at the timing, this trade came in heavy right around noon yesterday. Big block order, probably an institution or fund putting protection in. Could be nothing more than a hedge on long tech exposure, but it could also mean someone’s anticipating a decent-sized correction once earnings or macro data hit.

I’m not changing my 555C plan yet, momentum’s still holding for now, but if I start seeing open interest stack up on these deep puts and volume confirming downside, I’ll probably flip or hedge. For now, I’m just watching if this turns into a chain reaction setup or just a whale hedge move. Attached is my charting for the daily and the screenshot from UW.

1o0ja1l,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$POET - Someone Just Dropped $75M In and Won't Say Who (We Find Out Oct 17),"Alright so I've been digging into this POET Technologies thing because of that dumb fuck who keeps posting shit about them in the DDs so I said what the hell I'll take a look.

POET makes optical chips that connect GPUs in AI data centers. Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.

So on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says ""a single institutional investor"" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.

When I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.

The timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.

I started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up. Every major player in AI needs what POET makes.

And it's not vaporware, Foxconn selected them for their 800G and 1.6T modules. Semtech co-developed products with them and did a joint announcement. They're shipping samples to three major tech companies right now. Semtech wouldn't put their name on it if it was bullshit.

If someone bought 15% of the company, which is about what $75M gets you at $5.50 per share, they legally have to file with the SEC within 10 days. It's called a 13D or 13G filing. The deadline is October 17th. That filing has to show who they are, how much they bought, whether it's passive or strategic, all of it.

So in 10 days we're going to know if this was NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, whoever. If it's one of them this stock is going to fucking moon because it validates everything. If it's just some random growth fund then whatever. I'm here for the fucking casino.

Now look I'm not an idiot, there's a bear case here. Company has been around since 1972 and they're basically still pre-revenue, they did like $268K last quarter. They've lost $214M over their lifetime. They've raised $227M in the last 2 years alone, constant dilution.

But someone just put $75M directly into this company right as everything is coming together. No intermediaries. Right as production is scaling. Right as OpenAI is making major chip diversification moves. The structure looks exactly like the OpenAI-AMD deal with the warrants out to 2030. Either this is the luckiest timing ever or something's going on.

Position: I like to gamble so I picked up 1,000 $10C 10/31. I'm betting it all on a big partnership.

First it was MSFT and NVDA, then ORCL, PSTG, AVGO and now AMD.   AMD is giving OpenAI a warrant to get a 10% piece of AMD, and today’s 30% jump in market value easily covered that giveaway to OpenAI.  Who’s next? Or is this trade done?  

I’ve got my eye on MRVL, SMCI, TSMC in the chip space, LUMN at the edge/connectivity layer, and maybe PANW with security.   I think ARM didn’t get enough juice from the announcement that they were part of the initial AI pact between ORCL-OpenAI-ARM-SoftBank, but a one-on-one deal between ARM and OpenAI would deliver a big uplift to ARM.

$RGTI The Reality Check: Revenue and Margins Collapse

On paper, Rigetti is doing what every moonshot tech company does telling us about the future. But in the present, the numbers don’t inspire much confidence.

🔹Revenue dropped 41.6% last quarter.

🔹Gross margins halved from 64% to 31%.

🔹The expiration of the National Quantum Initiative funding hurt results (though there’s a chance Congress renews it).

The CEO sold ALL of his shares at $12 a few months ago. He owns no direct shares. 

They only did 1.7M in revenue last quarter and they are trading at a 15B+ market cap. 

To its credit, Rigetti raised $350M through an ATM offering, pushing its cash pile to $572M. That’s enough runway for a couple of years, but it came at the cost of heavy shareholder dilution.

In other words: Rigetti has breathing room, but not without watering down existing investors.

This stock went up like 25% last week because they sold 2 computers for 5 million dollars. Its valuation is insane. They will almost certainly dilute stock holders so they can raise $ for their incredibly capital intensive business. 

Please be careful and don’t fall for “hype” 

There is no business, or way to success for $RGTI. 

Please buy companies with good growth, and solid fundamentals like $AMZN, $MSFT, etc and let pigs get slaughtered.

The boring stuff:  
Repeated quarterly earnings records  
Debt is being reduced and consolidated to lower borrowing costs  
New boats (i.e. large capital expenditures) now taking paying customers  
2026 already half booked and at higher prices than 2025  
Stable EPS increases and adjusted net income trending upward at double digit rates

Q&A:  
Q: Why CCL stock?  
A: Only boats that have enough tonnage to support my mother. 

Q: Are you dumb?  
A: I can't read the question, can you ask it out loud? 

Q: Have you considered the fact it's hard to trade while at sea?  
A: Do you see how much [internet ](https://www.carnival.com/internet-plans)costs on these boats? That's called filthy profit margins. Truly disgusting.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?  
A: already long on PLTR, NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, and QCOM.

Thoughts? If this goes well I should be able to get a nice kayak to trade up from into a bigger boat.

1nxdjz7,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Signs Are Pointing to $QBTS Quietly Building Momentum for a 2025 Breakout,"$QBTS just secured $400M through an equity raise and added a NASA partnership, which strengthens both its funding base and credibility at a time when quantum computing is shifting from theory into real-world application. Insider activity between September 12 and 15 showed seven transactions totaling about $1.52M, with 79% of that value from sales. While that kind of selling can bring short-term pressure, it is often part of normal liquidity behavior for a company scaling at this stage. Against giants like $MSFT and $IBM, $QBTS is differentiating itself by pushing harder on commercialization. With the capital raise complete and adoption trends picking up, 2025 may be the year it proves whether it can hold ground in the broader quantum race.

Commercial traction is becoming clearer too, with bookings in Asia Pacific up 83%. Analysts are pointing to the stronger balance sheet and expanding customer adoption as reasons the outlook looks favorable. I actually made an entry on bitget to test the momentum but decided to exit for now and take more time to study the fundamentals before leaning in further.

Curious to hear how others on this sub are reading the company’s moves. Does the raise, NASA tie-in, and growth in bookings look like the right setup for long-term strength, or do you think the insider selling signals caution? Always interested in how the community here weighs in on these kinds of plays.

1nwhavv,post,options,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Anyone else watching the AI power bottleneck? ($BE, hyperscalers, and options setups)","Been digging into the whole AI infrastructure trade and realized something: everyone talks chips ($NVDA, $AMD) or software ($MSFT, $GOOGL), but the **grid might be the real bottleneck.**

Data centers are sucking up power at a pace the utilities can’t keep up with. That’s why weird names like **$BE (Bloom Energy)** are ripping — they can deploy mobile/clean on-site power fast, which hyperscalers might need if the grid lags.

The bull case is obvious: AI capex is basically bottomless right now. But the bear case is interesting too — what if demand for power simply can’t be met? That could stall capex cycles, delay purchases, and hit the whole ecosystem.

From a trading perspective:

* Volatility in these names cuts both ways
* Options can capture those violent moves (up or down)
* Momentum signals on short-term EMAs / MACD seem to work surprisingly well on these plays

Not advice, just sharing how I’m thinking about it. Curious if anyone else is setting up trades on the “AI power gap”?

Here’s how I see it:

* Short term: it’s going to push costs higher. $14B isn’t pocket change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this weighs on margins in upcoming quarters.
* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

Personally, I like seeing this move. It reminds me of when Amazon poured billions into AWS back in the day. Painful upfront, but it turned into one of their biggest growth engines.

1nuzqe0,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",0bserverZ,5,0.69,0,2025-10-01 07:18:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

1ntwo3a,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

1ntlfop,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",Goatofoptions,0,0.47,9,2025-09-29 17:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/

1nse5u1,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

UiPath has been working on robotic process automation since 2021 and getting nowhere fast. Down \~80% and been there since 2022. Wrong product and wrong time.

Then they figured out that LLM's exist and made Maestro. Maestro will do what Palantir's Foundry does but for business admin people who are not SAP programming experts. Maestro is software that will automate Gen X's enterprise needs. Thrilling, I know. But they have a partnership with Microsoft, they beat earnings consistently. their YoY customer retention is great, and they say 'agentic ai' a lot. So calls obviously.

If you want more thorough DD, check out NYCandrun's post earlier this month. Revenue from Maestro most likely won't show up on their Q3 earnings, but in case it does I have January 2026 calls and January 2027 leaps.

1nprxr3,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

The moment 185 breaks is the moment I could see this hitting 210.

1npo92f,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",r2002,260,0.83,114,2025-09-24 23:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/
1npbyeg,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

Everyone knows Nvidia invested in Open AI with 100 billions dollars. So, Open AI will get 100 billions dollars to buy Nvidia chipset for their data centers.  

If you got some knowledge about stockmarket history, this investment is typical what Cisco did with some client like ICG Communications.  
  
In the fact, Open AI is losing money and are not expecting to get money before 2028. So, Nvidia make an investment of 100 billion to allow them to buy the chipset. Yes, Nvidia makes a ""loan"" to his client because they don't have money. Cisco did the same

In AI business, lot of people make a big investment in data center because they've got money like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon ... but Open AI doesn't have the money. 

And what happen to ""cisco capital"" ? lot of companies declared bankrupcy during the .com crisis because the expected yield had never come. And Cisco will never get back the money.

1noibvq,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Transitioning our ROTH's from a managed brokerage (Ameriprise) to Fidelity...,"Hello all,

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

1nny89w,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",Mattdezenaamisgekoze,2,0.54,20,2025-09-22 22:51:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/

People told me to size smarter and grab longer-dated calls on $IREN, so I did. Also added some $GLXY to the mix.

Postion Before:

10k CIFR Jan Options

**My positions now:**

* **$IREN – $48k** (main conviction play)
* **$CIFR – $13k**
* **$GLXY – $7k**

# Why I’m in:

* These names are perfectly positioned for the **AI + Bitcoin + Datacenter** melt-up.
* If even *one* of them lands a big hyperscaler contract (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, w.e), it’s an instant **2x+**.
* My bet is on **$IREN** leading the pack. They’re scaling fast, and the “AI miner pivot” narrative is just starting.

# The Setup:

We’re heading into year-end with **AI mania + BTC halving narrative + risk-on rally** all converging. Once this sector catches another bid, people are going to be chasing hard.

If it goes right, I’m printing. If it goes wrong… well, let’s just say I’m riding this train until the wheels fall off. 🚂💥

1nnvw71,post,StockMarket,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Thoughts on JCI,"Looking at where hyperscaler contracts might land (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google). Has anyone thought about JCI (Johnson Controls)?

Cooling is a big deal.

Data centres are running hotter than ever because of AI and higher density racks. NVIDIA just reported a partnership with OpenAI to build 10 gigawatts of AI data centres using NVIDIA chips. That’s a lot of energy and a lot of heat generated.

Old school air cooling ain’t cutting it. I see that JCI’s offering Silent Aire coolant distribution units that scale from half a megawatt to 10mw+. That’s tailor made for hyperscalers building AI farms. They’ve announced a long term partnership with Tabreed (a giant district cooling company in the Middle East) to push for next gen cooling. 

JCI’s reach is bigger than people realize too.

NA: their biggest unit is lead by Julie Brandt, who just got a special RSU retention package because the board doesn’t want her going anywhere. Instead she’ll be leading the biggest growth market until 2027.

EU: strong in chilled water, smart building retrofits, and compliance heavy ESG projects. Hyperscalers love this because EU regulators are strict on efficiency.

APAC: Silent Aire has hubs in China, Singapore, India, and Australia. They’re selling chillers for crazy hot climates. Again, perfect for AI data centers.

Bottom line.

JCI might not be as flashy as NVIDIA or AMD but someone has to keep those AI racks cool.

Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

Do you think there's an underlying risk here? Or will this just last forever until eventually companies like OpenAI start making mountains of profits?

For years, Microsoft has been seen as OpenAI's exclusive partner, providing the Azure cloud infrastructure and integrating OpenAI's models deeply into its ecosystem. They had a deal for a huge chunk of OpenAI's profits and seemed to be in the driver's seat.

Now, Nvidia isn't just a supplier anymore; they're a massive strategic investor.

Does this mean Microsoft's influence is significantly reduced? Is their ""special relationship"" with OpenAI over? Are they now just one of two major partners, or does the Nvidia deal sideline them in the long run? It seems like OpenAI is diversifying its dependencies in a big way.

Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs first started rising when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies on Nvidia’s AI chips to develop its software and deploy it to users.

>It also signals just how many Nvidia chips OpenAI will need in order to develop next-generation artificial intelligence that can do more than its current models.

>“This is monumental in size,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview on Monday.

>“Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.

>In August, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of those costs are for Nvidia chips and systems.

>Nvidia will join a roster of investors that valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. Microsoft was one of OpenAI’s early investors, and has strategic partnership with it to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office.""









This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further. MAG7 is becoming more and more exposed to AI, with cash flows going towards datacenter buildout and training AI models rather than innovation or shareholder returns.",skilliard7,595,0.96,168,2025-09-22 18:19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnqz79/nvidia_will_invest_up_to_100_billion_in_openai/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnqz79/nvidia_will_invest_up_to_100_billion_in_openai/

1nm2ecd,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can’t lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

They just 5x their yearly revenue, but the stock is only up 40% on the announcement

Edit: just to add: I think people are underestimating the experience at nebius. Nebius comes out of yandex, which was the Google of Eastern Europe. Know for being a great company to work for who looked after their employees, the ceo was very against the Ukraine invasion, fled, took the top talent with him, and know you are look at a 20b market cap company that has people with experience of scaling world leading tech, and who are looking to make a stand",Longjumping_Kale3013,297,0.86,187,2025-09-20 18:17:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm2ecd/am_i_missing_something_or_is_nebius_free_money/
1nm0a5q,post,wallstreetbets,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

“Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm’s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron’s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.” 【Barron’s】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

They highlight Micron’s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.” 【Zacks / MarketBeat】

Micron Management Quotes & Context

“Micron’s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.” — Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  ￼

“Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise.

1nlw2gj,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,How do you handle it when you’ve got a hot stock? OKLO,"I’m particularly interested in hearing from longtime investors who have been through this before- 

Let’s say one of your holdings is doing really well, like skyrocketing. But of course, you know it can just as easily drop at the same rate. 

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA. 

Link to OKLO’s site https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

1nl1f0l,post,stocks,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",auradragon1,117,0.89,56,2025-09-19 13:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/

1njurb9,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion.

1njhtof,post,france,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,IA et Emploi : Dépasser l'optimisme technologique et commencer à préparer la transition dès maintenant - Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle,"Je vous partage ici le résumé d'une note d'analyse publiée par l'OIA, petit think tank français indépendant. Je trouve leur analyse pertinente et bien expliquée.

Et accessoirement même si ça commence à progresser dans le bon sens, je trouve ça dommage que le discours dominant soit encore que l'IA va simplement créer des emplois.

Et l'idée n'est pas d'être alarmiste ou de dire que ça va être l'apocalypse, mais simplement d'accepter que l'IA va avoir un impact important sur le travail en général et qu'on devrait essayer d'anticiper un peu.

Mais bon c'est sûr que c'est un problème de plus à gérer, dans un contexte déjà pas simple où les gens n'ont déjà pas assez d'espace mental pour les sujets courants comme ""changer de gouvernement""...

En tout cas c'est bien qu'il y ait des gens qui fassent ce travail d'analyse et d'explication.

Voici un résumé, je mets le lien vers le PDF en bas de page et le texte complet en commentaire :

**Source :** Observatoire de l'Intelligence Artificielle, Septembre 2025

# I. Contexte

* L'interview de Dario Amodei (CEO d'Anthropic) en janvier 2025 a relancé le débat sur l'impact de l'IA sur l'emploi avec ses prédictions alarmantes (moitié des emplois ""juniors"" pourraient disparaître, taux de chômage de 20% possible dans les 5 prochaines années, expression ""white-collar bloodbath"")
* Les réactions se focalisent souvent sur un argument rassurant : les gains de productivité permettront aux entreprises de produire davantage, sauvegardant les emplois existants et créant de nouveaux emplois
* Cette vision optimiste, largement reprise par les acteurs technologiques et certains dirigeants politiques/économiques, mérite d'être questionnée
* De nombreux éléments tangibles indiquent que ce postulat est au mieux optimiste, au pire utopiste, et qu'il est vital d'anticiper dès maintenant les disruptions majeures sur le marché de l'emploi

# II. Un scénario optimiste reposant sur deux hypothèses clés

# Première hypothèse (cohérente selon l'analyse) :

* L'IA générative permettra des gains de productivité significatifs, notamment pour les activités de ""production intellectuelle""
* Ce postulat fait largement consensus dans les milieux économiques
* Il ne s'agit généralement pas d'automatisation complète mais plutôt d'augmentation des travailleurs (""human in the loop"")
* Les travailleurs augmentés par l'IA remplacent les travailleurs sans IA, mais l'humain reste ""dans la boucle""
* Face aux gains de productivité, une entreprise peut choisir soit d'augmenter sa production, soit de réduire ses coûts à production équivalente

# Seconde hypothèse (largement fallacieuse selon l'analyse) :

* Les gains de productivité constituent un facteur de croissance du marché, provoquant une augmentation de la production plutôt qu'une réduction des coûts
* Cette hypothèse n'est valable que dans deux cas :
   * **Cas 1** : Secteur en croissance stable avec potentiel pleinement exploité - les gains de productivité permettent de répondre à la croissance sans embaucher
   * **Cas 2** : Secteur avec potentiel inexploité - les gains permettent de ""débloquer"" ce potentiel via réduction des prix
* **Problème majeur** : Dans les secteurs sans croissance ni potentiel inexploité, l'augmentation de productivité ne s'accompagne d'aucune croissance du marché - parfois même d'une décroissance
* Cette asymétrie entre gains de productivité et évolution de la production constitue un défi économique et social majeur de la révolution IA

# III. Une disruption sans précédent par son ampleur et sa vitesse

# Analyse de plus de 200 combinaisons secteurs/activités :

* **Objectif** : Comprendre le rapport entre augmentation de productivité grâce à l'IA, évolution du marché et impact sur l'emploi

# Résultats préoccupants :

# Activités fortement impactées par les gains de productivité :

* Administration, technologies de l'information (IT), relation client, marketing et communication
* Ces gains concernent une grande partie des activités internes dans la plupart des secteurs

# Secteurs avec augmentation de production compensatrice (minorité) :

* Technologies de l'information et communication, santé humaine, transports et entreposage
* Secteurs déjà en croissance ou avec potentiel ""déblocable grâce à l'IA""
* Même dans ces secteurs favorables, toutes les fonctions ne bénéficient pas de créations d'emploi
* Certaines activités subissent même des destructions nettes (cas déjà observé chez Microsoft, Meta, Google, SalesForce)

# Secteurs subissant une destruction nette d'emplois :

* Secteurs sur marchés matures, à croissance stable ou déclinants, sans potentiel significatif lié à l'IA

# Secteurs les plus vulnérables - Trois caractéristiques pénalisantes :

* Fort potentiel de gains de productivité grâce à l'IA
* Marché mature ou déclinant
* Possibilité de réinternalisation par les clients (entreprises/particuliers) rendue possible par l'IA

# Exemples concrets de secteurs à risque :

# ""Activités spécialisées, scientifiques et techniques"" (cabinets de conseil) :

* Avec ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude : les entreprises peuvent produire en interne analyses, études de marché, plans stratégiques
* Même si la productivité augmente dans les cabinets, la demande diminue par réinternalisation
* Provoque une contraction plutôt qu'une croissance du marché

# Services administratifs et fonctions support :

* ""Double impact"" : gains de productivité chez les clients + réinternalisation des activités sous-traitées
* Les fournisseurs de services touchés par réductions d'effectifs dues à la baisse d'activité

# Secteur financier et d'assurance :

* Marché mature avec gains significatifs mais aucune croissance compensatrice
* Impact sur comptabilité, analyses financières, service clients

# Secteur juridique :

* Quand l'IA peut fournir un conseil juridique de qualité, réduction de la demande pour cas standards
* Concentration sur les cas complexes nécessitant expertise humaine

# IV. Dynamiques systémiques amplificatrices

# Impact sur les postes d'entrée :

* Les postes ""juniors"" pénalisés en premier - ceux qui permettent aux jeunes d'acquérir l'expérience
* Paradoxe : les profils juniors, plus à l'aise avec l'IA, voient leurs opportunités se réduire
* Interruption de la transmission des compétences métiers, questionnant la formation des futures générations d'experts

# Autres facteurs systémiques :

* Plafonds de croissance méconnus dans les secteurs supposés compensateurs (contraintes ressources, énergie, infrastructures)
* Concentration des bénéfices entre les mains des détenteurs de capital technique
* Diminution du poids économique des travailleurs dans les négociations

# V. ""The elephant in the room"" : La transition dont personne ne parle

# Paradoxe majeur :

* Malgré l'évidence de la disruption, aucun acteur ne prépare réellement la transition
* Absence de préparation stratégique au niveau des entreprises ET des institutions

# Au niveau des entreprises :

* Plus de 80% des dirigeants tech anticipent une réduction des embauches dans les 24 mois, mais sans plan d'accompagnement structuré
* Même les dirigeants les plus avancés admettent ne pas avoir de consensus sur les niveaux d'embauche 3-5 ans

# Au niveau institutionnel - Cas du plan français ""Osez l'IA"" :

* Budget de 200 millions d'euros pour accélérer l'adoption de l'IA (objectif 100% grands groupes d'ici 2030)
* **Aucune ligne du programme ne traite de l'anticipation/accompagnement des travailleurs impactés**
* Illustration parfaite du déni : financer l'accélération de la cause sans tenir compte des conséquences
* Contraste avec le rapport de la Commission IA (mars 2024) qui citait déjà la nécessité de ""se préparer à la disparition de certains métiers""

# Inadéquation des mécanismes existants :

* Les dispositifs (formation, reconversion, soutien chômage) sont calibrés pour des transitions sectorielles graduelles
* L'IA va impacter simultanément de nombreux secteurs et fonctions, à grande échelle et sur période courte (probablement d'ici 2030)
* L'histoire économique montre que les transitions mal anticipées génèrent des crises durables

# VI. Recommandations pour une transition maîtrisée

# Principe directeur :

* Abandonner l'illusion d'une transition automatiquement bénéfique
* Adopter une approche pragmatique et proactive de gestion des risques

# Pour les décideurs politiques :

* **Abandonner le mythe de compensation automatique** et planifier une économie post-productivité avec nouveaux indicateurs (au-delà du PIB, incluant transition et impact social/environnemental)
* **Expérimenter des mécanismes de réallocation** des gains de productivité via système alimenté par les entreprises bénéficiaires
* **Créer des ""zones de transition protégées""** où l'automatisation est maîtrisée (secteurs stratégiques, métiers artisanaux, savoir-faire irréversible)
* **Investir massivement** dans les secteurs créateurs nets identifiés avec conditions d'accès favorables pour travailleurs déplacés
* **Anticiper les risques de ""dumping social""** et coordination internationale
* **Identifier secteurs prioritaires** propres à la France et programme de réindustrialisation
* **Dispositifs d'utilité publique** pour les citoyens, particulièrement les jeunes

# Pour les entreprises :

* **Maintenir le ""human in the loop""** en privilégiant augmentation plutôt qu'automatisation
* **Anticiper effets de réinternalisation** sur écosystème de fournisseurs avec démarche transparente/responsable
* **Développer stratégies de différenciation par l'humain** (créativité, empathie, relationnel)
* **Dispositifs d'accompagnement** aux risques psychosociaux

# Pour les travailleurs :

* **Privilégier secteurs/fonctions favorables** à l'emploi avec dispositifs publics renforcés
* **Développer compétences complémentaires** plutôt que substituables (que l'IA ne peut reproduire)
* **Préparation psychologique** à nouvelle relation au travail (volatilité, résilience, adaptabilité)

# Pour la société civile :

* **Questionner le modèle économique** de transformation des gains et pousser vers modèles alternatifs de répartition
* **Exiger transparence et participation** dans les décisions impactant massivement l'emploi
* **Repenser la valeur du travail humain** au-delà de la productivité économique
* **Créer des observatoires citoyens locaux** de l'impact IA sur l'emploi

# VII. Conclusion

# Réalité de la transformation :

* La révolution IA ne suivra pas les schémas rassurants des transformations passées
* **Asymétrie fondamentale** : gains de productivité massifs et rapides vs croissance ""compensatrice"" limitée à une minorité de secteurs
* Facteurs aggravants : réinternalisation d'activités, impact disproportionné sur postes juniors
* Transition plus complexe que ne le suggère le discours dominant

# Urgence d'action :

* Plus question de débattre de l'opportunité (transformation déjà en cours)
* **Construire dès maintenant** les mécanismes pour traverser sans fracture sociale majeure
* Abandonner illusion de transition automatiquement bénéfique
* Approche proactive, transparente et coordonnée entre tous les acteurs
* **Le coût de l'inaction pourrait être bien supérieur à celui de la préparation**
* Saisir la fenêtre d'opportunité pour anticiper plutôt que subir

1njct2n,post,investing,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Take profit and reinvest in the same asset?,"Hi investors -
Just taking a quick poll here regarding strategies for locking in gains. Does anyone take profits and then reinvest into the same asset?
For example, if you are up 150% on Microsoft and plan on holding it for another decade, when would it make sense to sell half and lock in those profits, and then start to DCA back in?
Also, I get that this is mostly a math thing. Can anyone help me think about it in terms of the numbers?",mrmses,0,0.23,18,2025-09-17 15:13:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njct2n/take_profit_and_reinvest_in_the_same_asset/
